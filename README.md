# The Minecraft Iceberg V3, Finally - 314+ Entries! (EXPLANATION DOC LINKED)

@ ZEROTH LAYERS:

Nether Portals - A rectangular portal made out of obsidian and lit with a fire source (often flint and steel), used to enter the Nether dimension. At its minimum size, it requires a vertical ring of obsidian 5 blocks high and 4 blocks wide, although at its maximum it can be 23 blocks by 23 blocks. Their existence is hinted at via ruined portals found in both the overworld and nether.
Usually, a created portal will generate an entirely new portal on the other side. However, if an existing portal already exists nearby in the other dimension, a created portal will link to that one instead. This means several nether portals can link to the same portal.

Strongholds - A hidden underground structure housing the end portal, which takes the player to the End dimension. Thrown Eyes of Ender (crafted with ender pearls and blaze powder) will guide a player towards the nearest stronghold.

Wither Summoning - The Wither, a somewhat secret boss, is summoned by placing three wither skeleton skulls atop a T shape of four soul sand blocks. When first summoned, the Wither is invulnerable and immobile, but after 10 seconds it'll release an explosion and start attacking, usually by flying around and shooting exploding wither skulls at nearby mobs. 
Mobs killed by the Wither will have a wither rose placed at their death location, which damages anything that walks on it.
Summoning the Wither is hinted at in one the paintings in the game.

Jockeys - The name given to a mob riding another mob. Jockeys with official names given are the Chicken Jockey (a baby zombie riding a baby chicken), the Spider Jockey (a skeleton riding a spider), and the Skeleton Horseman (a skeleton riding a skeleton horse, spawned only via a skeleton horse trap). 
Other unofficial jockeys include the Hoglin Jockey (one or more baby piglins riding a baby hoglin), the Ravager Jockey (a pillager riding a ravager), and the Strider Jockey (either a baby strider or zombified piglin riding an adult strider). 
Additionally, in Bedrock Edition, baby zombies can ride far more mobs than just baby chickens (See: Baby Riding Zombies).

Potion Brewing - Potion brewing is an incredibly convoluted process if you don't actually know what you're doing. This chart is incredibly useful in showing how to brew each potion in the game.

End Credits Poem - A message that appears after going through the Exit Portal once you kill the Ender Dragon. It’s written by Julian Gough, as per Notch's request call for someone to help include "silly over-the-top out-of-nowhere text" for the end of the game. The poem involves two speakers talking about the player’s accomplishments, as well as comparing “the long dream of life” to “the short dream of a game”.

"Steve?" - When asked what the player's name was, Notch jokingly responded with "Steve?", making up the name on the spot. It has since become the canon name for the player; when Alex was introduced in 1.8, the Change Skin menu on minecraft.net used the name Steve to refer to the original player model.

Music Discs - Music discs are obtained either from chests inside structures, or by getting a creeper killed by a skeleton/stray. Whereas most music discs were composed by musician C418, more recent discs (such as Pigstep found in bastion remnants or Otherside found in strongholds/dungeons) were composed by Lena Raine.

Beacons - A multiblock structure consisting of the aptly named Beacon block atop a pyramid of metal or gemstone blocks, upon which the beacon will shoot a beam of light into the sky and have the capacity to grant effects (assuming the beacon has an unobstructed view of the sky to begin with). These can range from a single layer of 9 block to four layers of 164 block total. Pyramids aren't unique to a beacon, so by some fiddling around one can place several beacons on top of a "stretched" pyramid thus using the fewest materials possible.
Five primary powers can be accessed via an activated beacon: Haste and Speed with one layer, Resistance and Jump Boost with two layers, and Strength with three layers. These powers are all at level 1 by default. With four layers, a secondary power is also available, which will be active alongside a primary power of your choosing. Secondary powers can either be Regeneration I, or the option to upgrade another primary power to level II instead. 
Via stained glass or stained glass panes, the beacon's beam can be colored as well. Combinations of colored glass will tint the beam properly, similar to leather dyeing (See: Leather Dyeing), meaning practically all colors in sRGB space (several million colors) are available.

Conduits - A multiblock structure consisting of the aptly named Conduit, made with Nautilus shells and a Heart of the Sea, surrounded by a minimum of 16 prismarine blocks 2 blocks away from the conduit (thus leaving a one block "moat" of water). An activated conduit provides unlimited Conduit Power in its range much like a beacon, giving water breathing, night vision, and haste. Three 5x5 open squares are the maximum number of prismarine blocks that can be added to the conduit, making 42 blocks in all.

Leather Dyeing - One upside to leather armor is its vast customization when it comes to colors. In Java Edition, leather armor can be dyed by crafting it with the dye of your choice, whereas in Bedrock Edition dyed water cauldrons (a feature exclusive to that version) can be used to dip clothes in instead. Leather armor can be dyed more than once, with subsequent colors being averaged into the mix. With this process, 12,326,391 colors are possible.

Desert Wells - An incredibly rare structure that generates in desert biomes, even if the “Generate Structures” option is disabled. It’s unknown why the vast majority of these wells were created so far away from most societies.

Dragon's Breath - The clouds produced via the Ender Dragon's fireball or breath attacks can be scooped up with an empty bottle in order to collect Dragon's Breath. In a brewing stand, these can be used to create lingering potions, which will create temporary clouds of their respective potion effect when thrown.

Seasonal Events - Around Halloween, from October 20th to November 3rd, a few small halloween-related changes would occur. Bats would spawn in higher light levels (from level 3 or less to level 6 or less), and the only splash text shown on the menu would be "OOoooOOOoooo! Spooky!" Additionally, exactly on October 31st, Zombies, Zombie Villagers, Husks, Drowned, Skeletons, Strays, Zombified piglins, and Wither Skeletons have a chance to wear carved pumpkins or jack o'lanterns on their head.
Around Christmas, from December 24th to December 26th, all types of chests would have their textures changed to resemble Christmas presents. The splash text would also read "Merry X-Mas!" for these days.

Sleeping In Other Dimensions - If you try to use a bed to sleep in the Nether or End, the bed will explode instead, setting fire to surrounding blocks. If the player is killed by this explosion, you'll receive the death message "(Player) was killed by [Intentional Game Design]". This also occurs with Respawn Anchors being used outside of the Nether.

Soul Sand Faces - The soul sand texture has screaming faces on it, suggesting that there are souls embedded within the block itself. Soul Sand may have marked the location of burial sites or graveyards for long-gone civilizations, or simply a natural process that occurs when mobs die near soil blocks in the Nether.

Chiseled Sandstone Symbols - Regular chiseled sandstone blocks have a creeper face on their sides. Red chiseled sandstone, on the other hand, has the symbol of a wither on it, as per the suggestion of reddit user ULiopleurodon. The red sandstone suggests that the concept of summoning the Wither dates back to even ancient times, although the motive behind summoning it is unknown.
Additionally, two unused decorative sandstone textures were added in Java 1.2.1. One depicts four symbols, including a creeper face and an eye, whereas the other is some striped diamond shape with two eye-like dots in the middle of it.


FIRST LAYER:

Herobrine - The classic creepypasta of an entity that’s claimed to be Notch’s dead brother. The first image of him was posted on 4chan’s /v/ board, while the first video hoax was created by Brocraft Streamer “Copeland”, which has since been taken down. Herobrine has since been accepted by both the community as well as Mojang, appearing in promotional art, a book in the 10th Anniversary World, and even in patch notes, where he’s jokingly* removed in every update. (Also See: Wake Up, Herobrine Shrine, Herobrine is Notch’s Dead Brother)

Creeper Origins - While Notch was trying to make the model for a pig, he accidentally swapped the height and length values for the body, making the resulting mob taller than it was wide. Notch was inspired by this odd model, and went on to make the creeper.
(Also See: Gray Prototype Creepers)

1.17 Content Split - Due to the sheer size and scope of the Caves & Cliffs update, Mojang decided to split the update up into separate parts. Part I contained all the blocks, items, and mobs, while Part II affected build height, surface + cave generation, and biome blending, as well as adding new mountain and cave biomes. The Deep Dark, another feature planned for the formerly singular 1.17 Caves & Cliffs Update, also developed into something far bigger than originally conceived, warranting another delay into a future update.

Cave Game - The very first version of the game, with only Grass and Cobblestone blocks taken from RubyDung, Notch’s earlier game (See: RubyDung). This version of the game was never released to the public, and was only shown off in videos which are censored in most countries for unknown reasons (See: Pre-Classic Censored Videos). This version of the game, which existed during Pre-Classic, was called Cave Game because it was only intended to be a test for cave generation.

Microsoft Influence - On November 6th, 2014, Xbox Game Studios (formerly Microsoft Studios) bought Mojang Studios and subsequently Minecraft for a whopping 2.5 billion dollars. This acquisition marked the start of true cross-platform play, as well as the management of Bedrock Edition by Microsoft (especially noticeable with the inclusion of the Minecraft Marketplace).
On October 21st 2020, Minecraft developers announced that Mojang accounts would be transferred over to Microsoft accounts beginning in early 2021. Players who did so were rewarded with a free cape, although those who were unable to (mainly due to not knowing the email they used for their Mojang account) were also unable to log in and thus play the game anymore. 

Creepers Are Plants - A popular theory that creepers are plants (hence why they’re green), and the reason they explode is to spread their spores. The official Mobestiary also reveals that Creepers have the capacity to distribute spores as well (although it's contradictory, since the cross-section reveals a TNT block suggesting that they're artificial). There's also the fact that the original texture for creepers is simply an edited and cut-out version of the existing leaf block texture.

Female Ender Dragon - The Ender Dragon drops an egg when killed. You can kinda fill in the blanks from there.
(Also See: Ender Dragon's Name is Jean)

Far Lands - Terrain generation bugs that start 12,550,821 blocks from spawn, as a result of an overflow error from the fractal noise Minecraft uses to create terrain. There’s multiple types of Far Lands (Edge Far Lands, Corner Far Lands, Skygrid, Stripe Lands), though the Edge Far Lands are most famous. Players experience multiple other bugs at these high distances, ranging from jitteriness to passing through blocks. In Beta 1.8 the Far Lands were removed due to a change in world generation, and in release 1.8 a world border was added to the game instead. 
In Bedrock Edition, the Far Lands still existed all the way until June 23rd, 2021, after which only the Stripe Lands continued to exist. For version 1.17's release in April of 2021, the Bedrock Far Lands were changed significantly, becoming thin strips of land connecting at right angles rather than a single jumble of noise terrain.

Tutorial Logo Nether Portal - The Legacy Console Editions of Minecraft contained tutorial worlds to help players learn the basics of the game. These worlds contained a giant Minecraft logo in the sky, and breaking into it often revealed a secret, ranging from a diamond-filled chest to an entire lit Nether Portal.


Pink Sheep - Sheeps can spawn in 6 different wool colors: White, black, gray, light gray, brown, and pink. Pink is the rarest color, with pink sheeps only making up 0.164% of all sheep. A baby pink sheep is even rarer, naturally spawning a mere 0.0082% of the time.

Nametag Easter Eggs - Naming a mob Dinnerbone (or Grumm) turns them upside-down. Also, jeb_ gives sheep rainbow wool, and Toast gives rabbits the appearance of xyzen420's girlfriend's missing rabbit.


SECOND LAYER:

2021 Mob Vote - The third community mob vote Mojang hosted, during Minecraft Live on October 16th, 2021. Like the 2020 Mob Vote, mobs that lost this vote could still be implemented, although the chance is fairly slim.
The 3 mobs were:
The Glare, a grassy ghost-like mob that would alert players if a nearby area is dark enough for monsters to spawn in.
The Allay, a blue fairy-like mob that would pick up dropped items in nearby loaded chunks based on what's initially given to it, dropping them off either near you or at a note block.
The Copper Golem, a small utility mob that would press nearby copper buttons in a random fashion. Like other copper items, the mob would undergo oxidation and eventually immobilize, although this could be reversed with an axe or being struck by lightning.
The Glare lost the first round with 11.2% of the 1,280,167 votes, and The Allay won the second round with 54.3% of the 1,173,315 votes. The Allay is slated to release in Java 1.19.

2020 Mob Vote - The second community mob vote Mojang hosted, during Minecon Live on October 3rd, 2020. Unlike the 2017 Mob Vote, mobs that lost this vote could still be implemented, although the chance is fairly slim.
The 3 mobs were:
The Moobloom, a Minecraft Earth mob that would spawn in Flower Forests along with a new flower, the buttercup. The mob would also have some interaction with bees.
The Iceologer, a Minecraft Dungeons mob that would spawn atop Mountains, hurling ice clouds at the player.
The Glow Squid, a Minecraft Earth mob that would spawn deep in Oceans or bodies of water in caves, illuminating them but not emitting light (similar to the eye glows of endermen or spiders). 
The Moobloom lost the first round with 28.3% of the 836,759 votes, and The Glow Squid won the second round with 52.7% of the 741,145 votes. The Glowsquid was added as a mob for Java 1.17, along with a new drop: glow ink sacs, that could make glowing item frames or signs with glowing text. 
It's widely speculated that popular youtuber Dream, whether intentionally or not, influenced the vote by telling viewers to vote for the Glow Squid via a tweet that garnered more than 100k likes.

2019 Biome Vote - The second community biome vote Mojang hosted, during Minecon Live on September 28th, 2019. Similarly to the 2018 Biome Vote, viewers could vote via Twitter poll to determine the order of priority for each biome update.
The 3 biomes were:
The Badlands, where tumbleweeds, vultures, and flowery cacti would be added.
The Swamp, where mangrove trees, treasure boats, and frogs would be added.
The Mountains, where goats, powder snow, and improved mountain terrain generation would be added.
The Badlands lost the first round with 14% of the 255,201 votes, and The Mountains won the second round with 53% of the 228,507 votes. Features for The Mountains were released for Java 1.17 and 1.18, with features for The Swamp slated for 1.19.

2018 Biome Vote - The first community biome vote Mojang hosted, during Minecon Earth on September 29th, 2018. Unlike the 2017 Mob Vote where only a single entry will be developed and the rest will be scrapped, all biomes featured in the poll would eventually get their listed features. Viewers could vote via Twitter poll to determine the order of priority for each biome update.
The 3 biomes were:
The Desert, where palm trees, meerkats, and oases would be added.
The Taiga, where berries, campfires, and foxes would be added.
The Savanna, where baobab trees, termites, and ostriches would be added.
The Desert lost the first round with 15.2% of the 55,992 votes, and The Taiga won the second round with 65.3% of the 54,281 votes. Features for The Taiga were released for Java 1.14.

2017 Mob Vote - The first ever community mob vote Mojang hosted, during Minecon Earth on November 18th 2017. Viewers could vote via a Twitter poll.
The 4 mobs were:
Mob A, The Barnacle (also called "The Monster of the Ocean Depths"), a squid-like ocean mob that would drag players down with a long tentacle.
Mob B, The Phantom (also called "The Monster of the Night Skies"), a flying creature that would spawn and attack any player that hasn't slept in 3 or more days.
Mob C, The Great Hunger, a lizard-like creature that would camouflage itself into the ground and eat mobs and items with a giant mouth, stripping enchantments from items when possible.
Mob D, The Wildfire (also called "The Hovering Inferno"), a blaze variant with spinning shields to defend itself, as well as a powerful shockwave to attack players with.
Mob A was eliminated in the first round with 23% of the 2,680 votes, Mob D was eliminated afterwards with 28% of the 4,697 votes, and Mob B won the final round with a close 52% of the 2,229 votes. The Phantom was released as a mob for Java 1.13. The other 3 mobs would never get any future implementation, according to Mojang.

2018 Cat Vote - A contest to determine the 9th Minecraft Cat skin, letting fans submit their own cat for a chance to get them into the game. Submissions lasted from October 13th to November 12th, 2018, and the 3 finalists by the end were Coco (a calico cat), Zach (a sphynx cat), and Jellie (a white tabby domestic shorthair cat belonging to GoodTimesWithScar). The finalists poll was held on Twitter on November 16th, 2018, and Jellie won with 48.5% of the 56,683 votes.  

Snapshot 20w14∞ - A joke snapshot released on April Fool's Day 2020, adding 2,147,483,647 randomized dimensions that can be accessed by throwing a book with anything written on it into a nether portal. In addition, 44 easter egg dimensions were also accessible if their respective words were written instead.

Minecraft Plus! - A screensaver collection for Windows announced by Mojang on April Fool's Day 2021, featuring Minecraft-themed versions of old screensavers Windows computers used to come with.

Minecraft 3D - Also referred to as "3D Shareware v1.34", this was a joke version of Minecraft for April Fool's Day 2019 that referenced 90s shareware titles such as Doom. The most notable changes were default retro shaders, exploding barrels, cheat codes, and mobs being rendered in 2D via billboarding.

PCX Textures - A joke texture pack for April Fool's Day 2018 replacing the default texture pack. All blocks were compressed down to using 8-bit colors only, resulting in drastically less detail.  

Mine & Craft Digital Leisure Device - A fake Game & Watch styled games console announced by Mojang for April Fool's Day 2017.

1.RV-Pre1 - Also known as the "Trendy Update", this pre-release for April Fool's Day 2016 added a handful of technological features, such as an ankle monitor that alerts the player if they're far from world spawn, and a 'smarter watch' that displays the time as well as chat notifications for significant milestones or taking damage. Reality Vision goggles were also added, hence "RV" in the version name. These goggles displayed a 3D minimap of the player's surroundings, although they also replaced text on signs with the word "OBEY" as a reference to the movie They Live.

Love and Hugs Update - Snapshot 15w14a was a joke snapshot for Java 1.10 released for April Fool's Day 2015, when 1.9 was still in the works. Instead of the player taking damage, a "love" meter would fill up, meaning one was effectively unable to die. Several other friendliness-themed additions were added, too. If the player reaches 8 full lines of hearts, they receive the ability to play Minescreeper in-game. Minescreeper plays just like the original game, Minesweeper, except with Minecraft textures slapped on.

T.E.A.V.S.R.P - Short for The Element Animation Villager Sounds Resource Pack. On April Fool's Day 2014, Minecraft became heavily "villager controlled": player skins were temporarily villager-themed, in-game music was added based on villagers, and all sound effects were replaced with villager noises recorded by Element Animation studios.
Though not related to T.E.A.V.S.R.P, Johan Bernhardsson (a developer for Pocket Edition) shared an image of the player bouncing a basketball for April Fool's day as well.

Java Edition 2.0 - A pre-release for a fake "2.0" version of Minecraft containing several joke changes and features, which was released to various youtubers for April Fool's Day 2013. 

Minceraft - The title screen has a 1 in 10,000 chance of displaying “Minceraft” instead of “Minecraft”. 

Dimension Layers - Though it’s never actually shown in-game, many fans speculate that the Nether exists below the Overworld due to its hellish feel and the existence of the nether ceiling, while the End is above it due to its space theme. In fact, the official Minecraft World Beyond poster art puts the End above the Overworld, and the Nether at the bottom. On October 22nd, 2020, Dinnerbone decomfirmed this theory in a Twitter post.
(Also See: End Dimension is an Asteroid Belt)

Infiniminer Inspiration - Infiniminer is an open-source sandbox game released on April 29, 2009, which inspired Notch to create his own version about a month later. In the description for one of Notch's early videos released on his old channel, showing a barebones version of Minecraft (then called "Cave Game"), he writes that "This is a very early test of an Infiniminer clone I’m working on."

Ancient Builders - A grand overarching theory that starts with an ancient civilization of builders, whether human or otherwise, once populating the overworld and subsequently other dimensions. Natural structures found throughout the game are chalked up primarily to the work of these ancient builders, who sought to conquer ever corner of the worlds and build elaborate buildings as a display of their prowess. Upon reaching the Nether for instance, they destroyed whatever civilizations the Piglins had, leaving nothing but Ruined Bastions. Eventually, however, some ill threat brought them all first into hiding (See: Strongholds Being Abandoned), before being obliterated completely.

Feeding Parrots Cookies - When parrots were first added they were attracted to cookies, as a reference to the famous "Polly wants a cracker" saying. In reality, chocolate is toxic to parrots. The cookie feeding mechanic was changed a few months later, such that feeding one to a parrot would instantly kill it.

Disc 11 & 13 - Disc 11 is a broken music disc with creepy audio that’s way different from all of the other discs. The sound at the end is theorized to be from either an Enderman, or simply a scratch on the disc. Disc 13 most likely contains the other half of the story too, with sounds of arrows being fired as well as a creeper explosion at the end. (See: Disc 11 Spectrogram)

Secret Igloo Basements - 50% of all igloos have a trapdoor leading to a dungeon, where a tutorial for zombie villager conversion can be found (See: Zombie Villager Conversion).

Cave Chickens - Sometimes, players could find chickens living deep underground in caves. This was a result of zombie chicken jockeys spawning deep down, with the chicken climbing into a one block high gap and subsequently suffocating the baby zombie.

Herobrine is Notch’s Brother - One popular theory for Herobrine is that he's actually Notch's dead brother, somehow embedded into the game. The theory originated as a result of the anonymous creator of the original Herobrine creepypasta claiming to have found this information through an interview with Notch himself. In reality, Notch never had a brother.
(Also See: Herobrine, Wake Up,Herobrine Shrine)

Nether Reactor - Before Pocket Edition had an actual nether, you had to create a structure called a Nether Reactor in order to generate a Nether Spire (pictured), inside of which were nether-related blocks as well as zombie pigmen and Glowing Obsidian.

Zoglin - A variant of the Hoglin that’s created when it enters a dimension other than the Nether. Zoglins attack almost any entity, including armor stands, though with the exception of creepers and other Zoglins. Much like Hoglins, Piglins also turn into Zombified Piglins when they enter the Overworld or the End.
(Also See: Piglins used Ruined Portals and became Zombified)

Sand Speeds Up Sugar Canes? - Even though some would believe that sugar cane grows faster on sand (as that is where it naturally generates), it actually grows at the same speed regardless of what base block it’s planted on.

Education Edition - A version of Minecraft initially released on November 1st 2016 and intended for educational use, containing features not present in the Java or Bedrock versions. There’s cameras, chalkboards, elements, programmable Agents, and more. Several features intended to be exclusive to Education Edition were accidentally added in Pocket Edition v0.16.0 alpha build 1, on August 29, 2016. However, they were removed shortly after.

Ores Near Gravel? - Many people have reported seeing ores generate more frequently near pockets of gravel, and even dirt. The most likely explanation for this, however, is that since gravel sticks out amongst stone and is easier to dig out, one might be more likely to clear out a pocket of gravel rather than any random patch of stone, thus finding more ores and diamonds in those places.
In 1.16 (and potentially previous updates), this rumor was made partially true due to the generation of gravel having some links to the generation of ores (See: Clay Diamond Trick).

Hermaphrodite Mobs - Minecraft animals often have traits from both sexes in the same texture. Cows have horns and udders, chickens have red wattles like a rooster but lay eggs like a hen, etc. Steve was also supposed to be a genderless human, even though their skin has a beard, and Alex was later added as a female variant to Steve.

Abandoned Villages - In Java Edition, Abandoned Villages (aka Zombie Villages) have a 2% chance of generating, with cobwebs, missing doors, and zombie villagers in the place of actual ones. In Bedrock Edition, however, this percentage seems to be 25%-30%.

Tower of Pimps - A tower of four gold blocks on top of an obsidian block, created by Gavin Free in Achievement Hunter’s Let’s Play Minecraft series. This tower was reference in a tutorial world on the Xbox 360 version of Minecraft.

pack.png - The default icon for resource packs, showing a Minecraft hill. SalC1 popularized the search for the seed this hill was taken from, and volunteer project Minecraft@Home found the seed to be 3257840388504953787 (versions Alpha 1.2.2a to Beta 1.7.3, at x=49, z=0).
(Also See: Title Screen World, Skull Painting Hill Seed)

Rubies - In the snapshots for 1.3.1, emeralds were originally intended to be rubies. However, it was quickly changed to a greener emerald texture, due to the possibility of rubies and redstone being too similar in appearance.

Nether Portals Were Made for Endermen - Nether Portals are 3 blocks high. One of the only 3-block high mobs in the game is the Enderman. Since Endermen have a black and purple color scheme, as well as a habit of teleporting around the place, it makes sense that Nether Portals were originally designed for Endermen to use. It could also explain why the Warped Forest has so many of them.

Void below Overworld - Right below bedrock in the overworld is an infinite expanse of void. It most likely isn’t “canon” in Minecraft lore, and only exists because a Minecraft world can only go down so far.

Enchantment Font - The font used for the Enchanting Table is the Standard Galactic Alphabet (a writing system invented by the Commander Keen video game series), but the actual phrases themselves are complete nonsense. The words are taken randomly from the following set: “air animal ball beast berata bless cold creature cthulhu cube curse darkness demon destroy dry earth elder elemental embiggen enchant fhtagn baguette fiddle fire-free fresh galvanize grow hot humanoid ignite imbue inside klaatu light-limited mental mglwnafh niktu of other phnglui physical range rlyeh scrolls self shorten shrink snuff sphere spirit stale stretch the towards twist undead water wet wgahnagl xyzzy”.
(Also See: Enchanting Table is Futuristic Technology)

10 Year Anniversary Event - To celebrate Minecraft's 10 year anniversary on May 17th 2019, Mojang released a web browser version of Minecraft Classic, gave discounts to modern Minecraft editions as well as the top 10 items on the Marketplace, and released a commemorative 10th anniversary map with several secrets (including a book signed with the name Herobrine). Additionally, from May 17th to May 20th, cakes had the number 10 placed onto them in celebration.

Fluid Interactions - Lava and water mix in different ways depending on how they're positioned. Water flowing onto or touching a lava source block will replace the lava with obsidian, a technique which is often used to create nether portals before gaining the ability to mine obsidian.
Lava flowing vertically onto water will turn the water into stone, whereas lava flowing horizontally will turn it into cobblestone instead. The latter is used to create cobblestone generators for AFK farming, most often in survival challenges such as Skyblock where little to no natural stone is available.
Additionally, if lava flows over soul soil and is adjacent to blue ice, the lava will turn into basalt.

Zombie Villager Conversion - Players can cure a zombie villager by feeding it a golden apple while it’s under the effects of weakness. The conversion time can take anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes. A tutorial for this can be found underneath some igloo structures (See: Igloo Basement). Cured villagers can have considerable discounts on their trades, as a way of saying thanks. This can be exploited.

Mob Lightning Conversion - When struck by lightning, villagers become witches, creepers become charged creepers, pigs become zombified piglins, and mooshrooms switch between red and brown variants (See: Brown Mooshroom).

Skeleton Horse Traps - An event that can rarely happen during thunderstorms. At first, only a single skeleton horse is spawned, but upon getting closer lightning strikes the horse and 4 skeleton horsemen are summoned (a possible reference to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse). These skeletons have enchanted bows and helmets. Unlike regular horses, skeleton horses don't drown underwater. This is because they don't have lungs.

Title Screen World - The Minecraft world found in the pre-1.13 title screen panorama comes from an existing seed, and volunteer project Minecraft@Home found the seed to be 2151901553968352745 (though 8091867987493326313 also works) (version Beta 1.7.3, coordinates X=61.48, Z=-68.73).
After this, all title screen seeds from 1.13 to 1.16 were discovered and compiled into a spreadsheet, courtesy of Minecraft@Home as well.

Swamp/Jungle Villagers - Even though Jungle and Swamp villages don’t generate naturally, villagers have their own special skins for those biomes, which can only be seen via spawn eggs, breeding, or curing a zombie villager.

Illusioners - An unused Illager that can only be spawned with the summon command. It mainly uses a bow to attack, but it can also use two spells; one that binds the player, and one that spawns multiple false duplicates of itself.

Killer Rabbit - For only a couple of snapshots in 1.8, the Killer Rabbit (a reference to the Rabbit of Caerbannog from Monty Python and the Holy Rabbit) was added as a naturally spawning mob with a 1/1000 chance of spawning. It was later reduced to 1/2500, before only being able to be spawned with the “/summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ {RabbitType:99}” command.

Creepers Spread Potions - If a creeper is affected by a potion, often through a splash potion, then their explosion will create a lingering potion effect cloud in its wake.

Secret Languages - The Languages menu of Minecraft has 6 easter egg languages: Pirate Speak, LOLCAT, Shakespearean English, Anglish, ɥsᴉlƃuƎ (ɯopᵷuᴉʞ pǝʇᴉu∩), and Pre-Revolutionary Russian. In addition, 4 conlangs are also added: Star Trek's Klingon language (tlhlngan Hol), one of Lord of the Rings' Elvish languages (Quenya), Esperanto, and Lojban (made by the Logical Language Group). [More languages may get added in future updates, so apologies if this count is outdated!]

Sky Dimension - A planned dimension for the Beta 1.8 Adventure Update, intended to be the complete opposite of the Nether both thematically and in terms of terrain. This sky dimension was scrapped, however, and was later replaced with the End dimension.

Dead Mobs Form Sculk - Mobs killed around a 9 block radius of a Sculk Catalyst create a patch of sculk and sculk veins where they died, suggesting that these blocks are the direct result of dead mobs.

Painting Origins - 25 of the paintings found in Minecraft are actually edited versions of real paintings by Kristoffer Zetterstrand. In fact, he was the one that created the Minecraft versions too! The Wither painting is completely original.

Chick Quadruplets - There is 1 in 256 chance for a thrown egg to spawn 4 baby chickens instead of just 1.

Notch’s Twitter - Notch occasionally used his Twitter account to share highly controversial opinions on race, gender, and sexuality, even endorsing the QAnon conspiracy. On August 28, 2020, he made a promise with Game Maker’s Toolkit that he’ll delete his twitter account if GMTK stopped mentioning politics on his channel. He followed through on his promise and deleted his account, though he reactivated it on September 22.
(Also See: Anti-Semitic Villager Caricatures)

Order Of The Stone - After Cave Game, Notch decided to rename the game to Minecraft: Order of the Stone, as a reference to the webcomic Order of the Stick. Eventually, he shortened it to just Minecraft. This name served as the inspiration for the group of ancient builders in Minecraft: Story Mode, a game by Telltale.

Ghast Sound Origins - C418 confirmed that the sound of the Ghast’s cries are actually a recording of his pet cat, which makes the noise when disturbed. 

Removed Splashes - Throughout the game's history, several splash texts have been removed. Comments about the current version or price at the time were first to go, and old pop culture references were taken out from time to time. 
A comment on SOPA (a highly controversial anti-piracy bill in 2012 that was rejected by the United States House of Representatives) was also removed in 1.9, as it had been a non-issue for several years by then. A splash text saying "Better than Prey!", referencing the 2006 game Prey, was also removed a few months after the release of Bethesda's 2017 game also named Prey.
After Notch's departure from Mojang following a slew of controversies, all splashes referring to him were removed from the game.

Zombified Piglin Green Blood - When Zombie Pigmen were first created by Xaphobia (See: THX XAPHOBIA), they had red blood. This was later changed to green blood, since Notch found it too gory. Some species of spiders have green blood, so could Zombie Pigmen actually be… part spider?? Probably not.

The Flattening - A change in Java 1.13 that affected several technical aspects of the game, including modifying IDs, block states, and NBT data. The biggest change is the removal of numerical IDs. Not only does this make referencing objects in the game far easier (since you don't have to memorize what numerical data tag something is in order to get it) albeit at the cost of breaking command blocks that relied on the old syntax, it also removes the hard limit on how many things Mojang can add to the game. In fact, them hitting this limit for blocks in 1.12 is mainly the reason why The Flattening occurred in the first place.

Brown Mooshroom - A rare variant of the regular Mooshroom, usually created when a Red Mooshroom is struck by lightning (See: Mob Lightning Conversion). It also has a 1/1024 chance of being created through breeding two Red Mooshrooms. Using a flower on a Brown Mooshroom lets it produce a suspicious stew imbued with a potion effect the next time it’s milked with a bowl.

Tutorial World Stampy Island - On an island found to the northeast of the world in the TU19/CU7 tutorial world of the Legacy Console Edition, an entire recreation of Stampy's house as well as the S.S. Stumpy from Stampy's Lovely World can be found.

Nether Chicken Jockey - A baby zombified piglin has a 5% chance of riding a chicken when spawned, meaning each zombified piglin spawned has a mere 0.25% chance of becoming a chicken jockey. This is the only way that chickens can spawn naturally in the Nether.

Turtles Drop Bowls - If a turtle is killed by lightning, it will drop 1 bowl.

Netherrack is Made of Flesh - A theory that netherrack is made of pure flesh. Pretty likely, seeing how much it looks like muscle tissue, as well as the fact that the Nether is already a pretty hellish dimension. Additionally, the original name for netherrack was "bloodstone". This could suggest that the Nether is the inside of one large decaying superorganism. 

End Bedrock Infiniburn - Unlike netherrack, which can burn infinitely in all 3 dimensions, bedrock only has the ability to burn infinitely in the End. This was most likely done to stop the fire generated from end crystals atop the obsidian towers from dying out once the crystal was destroyed.


THIRD LAYER:

Locked Chest - A feature added for April Fool's Day 2011 that required a "Steve Co. Supply Crate Key" to open, as a reference to TF2's Mann Co. Supply Crates. Buying these keys required going to a fake "Minecraft store", a GUI which had additional easter eggs including a Velociraptor at checkout as well as a seizure-inducing window if you bought more than $10,000 worth of goods.

Gears - Gears were intended to be an item used in mechanisms much like redstone, but it was never given any functionality. They had the ability to be placed on walls. It only existed from Indev 0.31 to Alpha v1.0.1, when redstone dust was added.

Herobrine Shrine - A structure a player could make out of a block of lit netherrack surrounded by redstone torches and gold blocks, that could supposedly summon Herobrine.

How Did We Get Here - A hidden advancement that requires you to have every obtainable status effect applied to you at the same time. This includes Absorption, Bad Omen, Blindness, Conduit Power, Dolphin’s Grace, Fire Resistance, Glowing, Haste, Hero of the Village, Hunger, Invisibility, Jump Boost, Levitation, Mining Fatigue, Nausea, Night Vision, Poison, Regeneration, Resistance, Slow Falling, Slowness, Speed, Strength, Water Breathing, Weakness, and Wither.

Endermen are Farlanders - On July 30, 2011, people on 4chan started petitioning for Endermen to be renamed to Far Landers instead, as a reference to the Far Lands (See: Far Lands). Notch then joked that instead of calling Endermen Far Landers, the Far Lands should be renamed to “The End” instead. That’s how the name for The End came to be. The Farlanders mod added on to this discussion; their story proposed that Endermen used to live peacefully in the Far Lands before it was taken from them, forcing the inhabitants to trek across dimensions seeking shelter before eventually settling in The End.

Super Duper Graphics - In E3 2017, the Super Duper Graphics Pack was announced. Boasting 4K HDR graphics, improved lighting, shadows, water effects and more, it was primarily geared towards non-Java platforms that didn't have the same freedom of shaders or resource packs to choose from. On August 12th, 2019, Mojang announced that the pack would be ceasing development, citing that it was too ambitious and technically demanding to implement properly. Earlier that year, however, testing for a new Bedrock rendering engine was underway. Dubbed RenderDragon, it successfully implemented new lighting techniques, performance upgrades, and even raytracing support, bringing in the features that were once promised for Super Duper Graphics all those years ago.

Abnormal Cacti - Minecraft@Home, the volunteer project that found the seeds for pack.png and the pre-1.13 title screen world, is also responsible for tracking down the tallest cactus possible in Minecraft. As of 3 July 2020, they have found a 22-block tall cactus in a normal world, and a 24-block tall one in a superflat world. The reason why Minecraft cacti can grow so tall despite only naturally growing to a height of 3 blocks is because these aren’t technically one single cactus; Minecraft generation can often put multiple cactuses on top of one another, leading to some incredibly rare 3+ block ones. 
This can also be the case with sugarcanes; in fact, due to valid natural generation locations for sugarcane being far less than cacti, abnormally tall sugarcanes occur more frequently than for cacti.

Story Mode Discontinuation - Minecraft: Story Mode is an episodic series released by Telltale Games. Season 1 was released on October 13th 2015 with 8 episodes in all, while Season 2 was released on July 11th 2017 with 5 episodes by the end. 
Financial troubles and a lack of major investors to fund projects meant Telltale Games went through severe employee layoffs and studio closures on September 21st 2018, with the company officially going defunct on October 11th of that year. 
On May 31st, 2019, Minecraft staff announced that Minecraft: Story Mode will soon stop being published due to the publisher no longer having the license to sell or distribute them. Story Mode was discontinued for good on June 25th, 2019.

Fire Chainmail - Chainmail armor can only be obtained through trading with villagers, but until 1.8 there was a creative-only recipe for it by putting fire blocks in a crafting table.

Johnny - Renaming a Vindicator to “Johnny” causes it to attack every mob in sight, with the exception of Ghasts and other Illagers. This is a reference to the “Here’s Johnny!” scene from The Shining, where Jack Torrance chops down a door with an axe.

Red Dragon - A planned mob that Notch intended to release alongside the Ender Dragon, as an overworld boss mob. The Red Dragon was never implemented, however. Dinnerbone has said in the past that the dragon may be added to Minecraft in a later update, though there aren’t any plans to do so anytime soon.

Stunned Endermen - If you continue to stare at an enderman, even after they’ve become angered, they’ll temporarily lose the ability to move or teleport, making them much easier to attack.

Zombie Horses - An unused zombie variant of the horse that was added to Minecraft in 1.6.1, at the same time as regular ones. Much like skeleton horses, zombie horses don't drown underwater. This is because they're already dead.
(Also See: Skeleton Horse Trap) 

Flying Machines - Redstone mechanisms that use pistons, slime blocks, and redstone blocks in order to create a structure that can move across the sky indefinitely. One of the most common engines used involves having a regular piston push the structure forward, then having a sticky piston push a slime block backwards in order to retrieve the piston and then start the cycle over again through the use of redstone blocks.

Floating Grass - Since the addition of one-block grass blocks on May 26 2011 (Beta 1.6), grass blocks could often be found in the world floating in midair or on blocks other than grass, as a result of generating before natural features such as lakes could perforate the world. This bug was fixed on May 19, 2021, during Java Edition 21w20a.

Luck Potion - A potion that gives you the luck status effect, which increases your chances of getting better items from loot tables that use a quality score. So far, only fishing gives loot items this score. A Luck of the Sea fishing rod passively increases a player's luck when in use. 

Green Steve - A somewhat popular creepypasta that involves a green version of Steve attacking a player in a Desert Temple after they noticed the TNT trap didn’t go off. According to the story, a developer snuck Green Steve into the game against the refusal of other devs. The Green Steve creepypasta led to a few spinoffs, including Red Steve and Blue Steve (a reference to the RGB color scheme used in electronic displays).
Other popular Minecraft creepypasta entities include El Lick (a man wearing a white mask, associated with crosses in world generation) and yraniB (a corrupted Steve, associated with crashing the game and displaying binary in chat). They didn't stand out enough to warrant their own entries, but I figured I'd still include them in here somehow.

Missing Texture Block - In Java Edition, when the game detects a block with an invalid ID (often a result of switching between versions where blocks are removed or have yet to be added), their texture is replaced with a purple and black checkerboard pattern. Prior to Java 1.6.1, the missing texture block was simply white with black text that said "missing texture". In Bedrock Edition, blocks are instead replaced by the info_update block: a dirt block with the word “Update!” written on all 6 sides.

Item Duplication - Minecraft has had multiple item duplication glitches in its history, the most famous exploits of which included placing a door next to a cactus on top of a block of sand in order to duplicate the door, and placing an item into a chest then back out, then completely exiting out the game without saving in order to get double what you took out.

Nether Ceiling - A flat expanse of land located just above the bedrock ceiling of the Nether. Though you can’t break the bedrock directly, you can phase through the ceiling by throwing an ender pearl into a small gap or a stair block, or pushing a minecart via piston into the ceiling. The lack of obstacles above the ceiling make it a great way for players to cross huge distances easily, since one block traveled in the Nether is eight blocks in the overworld. 

Wololo - Evokers have an easter egg that causes them to change the color of blue sheeps to red by shouting “Wololo”. This is a reference to the Priest’s conversion ability in Age of Empires, which allowed their army to gain control of an opponent’s unit, thus having them switch sides.

Enchanted Golden Apple Recipe - When regular golden apples were first introduced in Infdev on February 27th, 2010, they could be crafted with an apple surrounded by 8 gold blocks and gave fairly strong buffs. In Java 1.1, they were nerfed significantly and only required 8 gold nuggets to craft (for reference, one gold block could produce 81 gold nuggets). 
In response, Enchanted golden apples were added in 1.3.1, having the original crafting recipe of 8 gold blocks but giving far stronger effects as a result. As part of the combat update in 1.9, enchanted golden apples were made uncraftable, meaning the only way to obtain them now are to find them in structure chests throughout the world.

Mushroom Light - Brown mushrooms (as well as dragon eggs) emit a small light level of 1, with the former becoming a light source in Indev 0.31. Additionally, blue ice originally gave off light level 4 in Bedrock version 1.4, although this was removed in version 1.17.10.

Testificates - For a brief time in the Beta 1.9 Prerelease, when villagers were added, they all had the name “TESTIFICATE” above their heads.

Post-Apocalyptic Future - A theory that Steve is the sole survivor in a mutated wasteland, hence why there's so many undead creatures prowling the landscape. Villagers are probably also mutants, forced to rebuild civilization from scratch after all technology was wiped out. 

Raspberry Pi Edition - The Raspberry Pi is a small computer, mainly used for computer science and programming. Mojang released a free version of Minecraft for it, with only a limited number of features since it’s based on the Alpha Pocket Edition versions, as well as the player's name permanently* being StevePi. However, this version also comes with a Python programming interface, allowing players to add their own code to manipulate the game. This also meant players could just edit their name in the executable to something different.

Wax Block - A texture added to the game files for 1.15 during a snapshot released on August 22nd, 2019, along with the texture for an item called Crystallized Honey. Both were removed on October 16th 2019, with developers claiming that they were accidentally added to the game files and never intended to be used. Waxing as a concept, especially when it comes to copper objects, was taken up by the honeycomb item instead.

Quiver - An unused item that could’ve been used to store multiple stacks of arrows in one inventory slot. Only the texture for the item existed, and even that was removed with the 1.9 Combat Update. (Also See: Legend of the Chambered)

Super Secret Settings - Until 1.9, there used to be a button in the options menu that allowed you to toggle between 24 different types of filters, some of which are obtainable by spectating from the viewpoint of certain mobs (See: Mob Perspective Filters).

Minicraft - A 2D Top-Down version of Minecraft created in 2 days for Ludum Dare in 2011.

THX XAPHOBIA - An easter egg in the old Zombie Pigman texture file crediting Xaphobia, the creator of the mob (which originally included red blood). P.S., Xaphobia prefers to pronounce their name as “X a phobia”.
Similarly, texture files for the Guardian and Elder Guardian hid the word "jeb" inside them. 
Both the jeb and THX XAPHOBIA signatures were removed with the 1.14 texture changes, although signatures for Jappa and Searge can still be found in the texture for armor stands.
(Also See: Zombified Piglin Green Blood)

Notch Drops Apples - From Indev until 1.3.1, any player with the name “Notch” dropped an apple when killed. Since it wasn’t until the 1.8 Pre-release that apples could actually be found in the world (and even then only in Stronghold chests), this used to be the only way to obtain apples.

Undead Giants - An unused mob that's essentially a 12-block high zombie, implying that actual giants once roamed the Minecraft world. 

Removed/Unused Biomes - Tundras, Rain Forests, Seasonal Forests, Ice Deserts, and Shrublands have since been removed in the Java Edition of the game, whereas Legacy Frozen Oceans, Desert Lakes, Mountain Edges, Deep Warm Oceans, Biome Hills, Badlands Plateaus, Modified Plateaus, Modified Wooded Badlands Plateaus, and Mushroom Field Shores have also been completely removed from Java Edition but simply exist unused in Bedrock Edition. Ice Deserts are an interesting case; before being removed it was implemented into the code but not properly added into the temperature/rainfall table, making it unable to generate.
As of 1.18, several more redundant sub-biomes have been removed from the game to be merged with their parent biomes in Java, whereas they still exist unused in Bedrock Edition.

Baby Riding Zombies - In the Bedrock edition of Minecraft, baby zombies can ride far more mobs than just chickens, ranging from pigs and cows to adult zombie variants. Additionally, if the mount they were initially riding gets killed, they're able to seek out a new mount to ride.

Zombies Dropped Feathers - From February 19 2010 (Indev) to September 9 2011 (Beta 1.8 Pre-Release), zombies would only drop feathers. The reason for this was twofold; Notch didn't know what they should drop, and chickens as a mob wouldn't be added until July 30 2010.

Endermites are Parasites - Ender pearls may not be Endermen eyes, but rather the eggs from which Endermite larvae hatch (hence why pearls have a small chance of spawning them when thrown). These Endermites may have infected humans traveling to the End for the first time, leading to the corrupted Endermen they are today. 

Mobs Afraid of Cats - Why are phantoms and creepers afraid of cats?? What the fuck did the cats do to them 

Unused Pigmen - Before villagers were a thing, Minecraft user Miclee suggested using Pigmen (an un-zombified variant) to populate villages. Miclee was given a Bacon Cape for his idea, but it was later removed after other people asked for capes too.

META-INF - A security/integrity measure added into Minecraft to ensure that everything in the files is how it should be, by comparing it to META-INF’s signature. In order to mod the game (thus modifying the files), you have to delete META-INF first. Mod loaders such as Forge or Fabric take care of this for you.

gargamel - A seed that existed from Beta 1.3 to Release 1.7.2, containing massive valleys and mountains at spawn. The name of the seed is a reference to the villain from The Smurfs. It became incredibly popular for its breathtaking terrain, which couldn’t really be found this close to spawn in any other seeds.

Endermen Backwards Speech - Endermen voice clips are actually distorted and reversed versions of "Hi", "Hello", "What's up" / “What the”, and "Look for the eye". 

Legacy Console Ruins - Underneath the icebergs in the 1.13 Legacy Console Edition aquatic tutorial world were the ruins of the previous tutorial world, where you can find a secret chest with a music disc. See this video at around 5:20.
A similar easter egg existed in the updated online minigame lobby, where the ruins of the previous lobby could be seen and accessed through a hidden path.

null - A creepypasta claiming that Herobrine is actually someone trying to warn players about a much more dangerous threat, a pure black entity named null.

Entity_303 - A creepypasta about a former Mojang employee that was fired and wanted revenge. He recruited a team of hackers to corrupt worlds and rename files to include "303" as a marker. According to the story, 1/40 players are affected by the hacks. The creepypasta led to numerous spinoffs, including Entity Zero.

3D Anaglyph - An option that applied a red and blue 3D filter to the screen, allowing you to play with 3D glasses on. It was removed in 1.13.

Crash Log Easter Eggs - At the top of crash reports generated by the game, a variety of easter egg comments can be found; which one is displayed is based on the system time (in nanoseconds) that the crash occurred on. Also after a crash, on the game output launcher tab (separate from a crash report), the line describing the game in the process of closing is written humorously as "Someone is closing me!"

MD3 Models - A model format created by Id Software. Beast Boy, Steve, Black Steve, and Rana were MD3 models created by former Mojang artist Dock, to use as a test during Indev. Models from the game Quake were also used, since they had the MD3 format as well. After Dock left, the models were scrapped, along with an unused Minecraft logo concept he made.

Canceled Minecon 2014 - While it was announced on March 30 2014 that Minecon would be held in Europe, on August 21 Vu Bui (Chief Operating Officer of Mojang) stated that Minecon 2014 will be canceled, and will instead take place in spring of 2015. The reasons for the cancellation are unknown.


FOURTH LAYER:

Missingno Splash - If you delete every splash text in the splashes.txt file, the Minecraft splash reverts to "missingno". This was removed in modern versions, however, and replaced with a Zero-Width No Break Space (represented in Minecraft's font as a box with "ZWNBSP" inside of it).

Dragon Egg Origins - Who fucked the dragon

Mob Perspective Filters - In spectator mode, players have the ability to see through the eyes of entities, including armor stands. Certain mobs can apply filters to your screen while being looked through. An enderman’s vision inverts and slightly desaturates colors, creepers have a green tint, and spiders have 5 screens where each of the eyes would go.

Void Fog - Until 1.8, Void Fog would decrease the distance you can see, getting thicker the further down you go starting at y=17. The fog was removed due to performance issues.

Arbalistic - A hidden advancement that requires you to shoot five unique mobs with a single crossbow shot.

Axolotl Wardens - Inverting the colors for the Warden gives them light pink skin and dark pink horns, almost exactly the color scheme used for the axolotls.

Hidden Splash Text - In the splashes.txt file, one line never shows up in the game: “This message will never appear on the splash screen, isn't that weird?”

Nautiluses Are Extinct - Only nautilus shells exist, and not nautiluses themselves. Where are they? Since nautilus shells create powerful underwater conduits when combined with a heart of the sea, It's possible that these animals were hunted to extinction by an earlier civilization as a result. 

Villager Eye Colors - Whereas most Villagers and Illagers have green eyes, Vindicators have blue eyes while Witches have purple eyes. 

Strongholds Being Abandoned - Strongholds are usually built to protect against attacks, so the End Portals used to be guarded and revered as a final bastion (possibly of those once residing in the also empty Deep Dark Cities) before being seemingly abandoned. The Warden may have been a golem-esque guardian for these strongholds, due to its name as well as its color scheme matching that of an End Portal frame. The plausible theory for why these structures were abandoned is that everyone involved simply went through to the other side. Seeing how there's no humans left in the End, though… (See: Endermen are Corrupted Humans) 

Grassless Dirt - The original version of coarse dirt that was added in 1.7.2, sharing the exact same texture as regular dirt. It generated in Mutated Savanna biomes (originally called Savanna M). Grassless dirt was later replaced with coarse dirt in 1.8.

Pre-Activated Ender Portals - In stronghold portal rooms, each end portal frame has a 10% chance of already having an eye of ender inserted into it. With 12 frames in all, that means each portal room has a 1 in 1,000,000,000,000 (1 in 1 trillion!) chance of spawning with all 12 eyes in, thus activating it without the player having to do anything.

Brick Pyramids - A 32-block high pyramid, added during Infdev to experiment with structure generation. These massive structures spawned at the same coordinates every time, no matter the seed.
 
Disc 11 Spectrogram - Putting the audio of Disc 11 into a spectrogram reveals an image of Steve's head, as well as the number 12418. The number is C418's signature, since C in hexadecimal is 12 in decimal.

cave14 Spectrogram - Much like Disc 11, cave14 also has an image when put into a spectrogram, though this time it's the iconic creeper face.

Endermen are Corrupted Humans - A theory that humans don't exist in the Minecraft world because they've all been turned into Endermen. The Endermen Backwards Speech possibly supports this theory as well, as remnants of human language (See: Endermen Backwards Speech). How they became Endermen in the first place, however, is another question. Maybe they simply turned into them while in the End, much like Piglins in the overworld do. They could also have been corrupted by another mob, such as Endermites (See: Endermites are Parasites), or simply mutated from eating too many chorus fruits, permanently gaining the ability to teleport at the cost of a disfigured appearance. 

Monoliths - Huge pillars of terrain stretching to the height limit that appeared as a terrain glitch in Infdev, due to a bug with the Perlin noise terrain generator.

PC Gamer Demo - A demo version of Beta 1.3 that was found in the June 2011 version of PC Gamer magazine. The demo was 5 days long, and special features included a giant wool PC Gamer logo, a bonus chest, a secret chest underneath spawn containing 22 gunpowder, and cow textures having the PC Gamer logo on them. There was a bug that allowed the player to continue interacting with the world even after the demo, by going at or above y=89.

Incurable Zombies - The player is able to cure zombie villagers (See: Zombie Villager Conversion), yet regular zombies can't be cured. Perhaps they’re too far gone to be cured, or maybe they were never alive to begin with. 

Moon Phase Effects - Certain phases of the moon can have subtle effects on mobs. The frequency of slimes spawning in swamps is proportional to how much of the moon can be seen, so a New Moon spawns no slimes while they spawn the most frequently during a Full Moon. A fuller moon also increases the chances for skeletons and zombies to pick up items and spawn with weapons and armor, as well as increasing the chances for spiders to spawn with status effects such as invisibility. Lastly, during a Full Moon, 50% of spawned cats will be black cats.

More End Dragons Existed - Although the current Ender Dragon is the last one of its kind by the time the player gets to the End, the existence of dragon heads on end ships suggests that there once were more dragons throughout the dimension that were gradually hunted to near extinction by an ancient civilization (See: Ancient Builders). This final Ender Dragon, housed within healing ender crystals, may be a last-ditch conservation effort to artificially keep the species alive (even though it's impossible for the population to grow with just a single dragon).

Ender Dragon Enslaved Endermen - A theory claiming that the Ender Dragon is a ruthless dictator, rather than the leader of the Endermen. For one, The End initially doesn't have an exit; one can enter The End, but until the dragon is defeated they can't leave, forcing them to die or potentially become turned into an Enderman themselves (See: Endermen are Corrupted Humans). Endermen originally had green eyes before being changed to purple, the change occurring on September 13th 2011 in "Java Edition Beta 1.8 Pre-release 2 ;). One could argue that an in-game reason for the change is due to the Ender Dragon mind-controlling the Endermen, since the dragon was implemented into the game exactly one month after the eye color change. In addition, slaying the Dragon grants you the advancement "Free The End", yet another piece of evidence to suggest that Endermen were enslaved under the dragon's rule. It's likely that the Warped Forest Help Sounds are the result of Endermen that have somehow escaped the End through all odds, and are now trying to find anyone that can put a stop to their race's suffering (See: Warped Forest Help Sounds). 

Monsters Under Your Bed - Before Minecraft 1.0, when mobs were able to spawn in dark areas for the first time, there was a chance for a mob to suddenly spawn and wake you up before the night was over, if your bed was in an unlit area. This gave the impression that the monster popped out from under your bed. This was an intentional feature, not a glitch, because even Notch joked about this happening.

Rabbits Scared Ravagers - When Ravagers were first introduced, they ran away from any rabbits near them. This feature was removed in the next snapshot. Wardens were initially proposed as being the exact opposite, attempting to befriend rabbits instead, although this idea was never implemented.

Human Goat Screams - In a Youtube video released on the official Minecraft channel, it was revealed that the goat noises heard in the game are a 50/50 mix of real goats and human voices.

Clay Diamond Trick - On roughly 80-85% of seeds, clay patches in bodies of water will be reliably linked to diamond ore generation based on a Z offset, depending on the biome. This Z offset wraps around in the same chunk boundary (boundaries can be seen with F3+G), so if it's about to cross into a new chunk it'll simply continue on the opposite side of the chunk it's in to prevent that. 
For 1.16: In swamps, going roughly 8 blocks south (with chunk wrapping still in mind) will lead to diamonds 50% of the time, whereas in rivers going roughly 3 blocks south will lead to diamonds 37% of the time.
Gravel in any biome can also be an indicator of diamonds in about 75% of seeds. Going roughly 14 blocks south yields diamonds 75% of the time in these seeds.
In 1.17, going 3 blocks south in a swamp is enough, and in rivers you only have to go 2 blocks.

Lapis Diamond Trick - In 1.17, the ore generation of lapis and diamond appeared to be linked. By going roughly 4 blocks north from a vein of lapis and digging up or down, one could reliably find diamond. Much like the Clay Diamond Trick, chunk wrapping has to be kept in mind: if your counting leads you to the edge of the chunk boundary you're in (boundaries can be seen with F3+G), you have to continue counting on the opposite side of your current chunk.

Giant Fossil Origins - Underneath Desert and Mesa biomes (as well as Soul Sand Valleys in the Nether), you can find giant skeletal ribcages and bones. These may have once belonged to dinosaurs, or some other giant beast that used to roam the Minecraft world. (Also See: Giant Zombies) 

Legacy Frozen Ocean - A biome consisting of nothing but an ocean with a sheet of flat ice on top. While it's unused in the current Bedrock edition of Minecraft, it once existed in Pocket Edition Alpha from the very first release on August 16th 2011 up until v0.9.0 on June 9th 2014.

Quantum Chests - A single chest block can store 27 stacks of items, or 1728 items in total. Realistically, this is completely illogical; a chest can store several stacks of blocks inside of it despite only being the size of a single block. The only explanation for this is that all chests lead into some sort of finite quantum space. Ender Chests may have been a result of earlier civilizations discovering this and exploiting it to have chests share the same quantum spaces.

End Dimension is an Asteroid Belt - Seeing how there's chunks of rock floating in an endless void, there's a good chance that the End takes place somewhere on an Asteroid Belt. If it is in space, though, why doesn't Steve run out of air? (See: Steve Is A God)

Old Stonecutter - A block that was added to Pocket Edition Alpha on January 30, 2013, as a way to craft stone-type blocks that couldn’t be made via a crafting table (a result of the small space on the MATTIS Crafting Menu). On November 2, 2015, every block was made craftable in a crafting table, rendering the stonecutter obsolete.
(Also See: MATTIS Crafting Menu) (Oh, it’s right under this. Hm)

Removed Potion Types - Before 1.9, potions used to have a form known as "reverted", which brought a potion back to a weaker form. Adding glowstone dust to a few extended potions removed their extended times, whereas adding redstone dust to a few enhanced potions stripped them of their stronger effects. Adding fermented spider eyes to a few stronger or reverted potions both corrupted and weakened the potion as well. Reverted potion types were removed on July 29th, 2015.
In addition, on September 29th 2011 (back when brewing was intended to be used via cauldron rather than a new brewing stand block), 32 base effect potions were implemented. On October 6th 2011 an actual brewing stand system was finalized, and all but 3 base potions were removed; only the Mundane, Thick, and Awkward potions remained.

Damage Tilt Is Broken - Every time the player is hit in the game, the camera tilts to the left. This isn’t actually intended behavior; the camera is supposed to always tilt away from the direction the player took damage. The current system is a result of a bug introduced in 1.2.5.

Ender Dragon's Name Is Jean - 9 years ago, when asked about what the Ender Dragon's name is, Notch responded with "Jean?", much like how he responded with "Steve?" for the player character's name. 

Bloodstone - The original name for netherrack, back when it was first introduced in Alpha on October 29th 2010. Notch also occasionally referred to the block as netherstone. In Beta 1.0 the block was officially named Netherrack.

Cave Ambience Crash Sounds - The sounds that play randomly to indicate unexplored caves seem to replay what may have been a horrific minecart/train crash in a mineshaft. Cave sounds 1-16 are the sounds of whistling, steam being released, and wheels rolling across rails. Cave sounds 17 and 18 stand out, however, as they seem to play the sound of two minecarts ramming into each other, and one of the carts subsequently getting derailed and falling. Cave sound 2 is described by some to be angelic humming.

Flying Squids - While the velocity of a squid is supposed to stop once it reaches the surface of the water, a bug in the Squid’s code when it was first released in Beta 1.2 meant the squid could just keep going upwards, eventually swimming in the air. A hasty fix meant that for a long time squids were prevented from swimming upwards completely, leading to each squid eventually gathering near the bottoms of lakes and oceans. This counter-bug was patched in 1.8.

Woodland Mansion Cult - Secret rooms in the Woodland Mansion contain idols, a meeting room with a map, jail cells, and a fake End Portal, indicating the Illagers have some sort of ultimate goal behind the scenes. There’s also a room full of light and dark blue wool, the same colors as Minecraft Steve’s shirt and pants.

Horse Armor Recipe - For just 2 snapshots in the 1.6.1 update, horse armor could be crafted by surrounding 6 iron ingots, gold ingots or diamonds around a block of wool. It's unknown why these recipes were removed, though one reason could be that horse armor doesn't break, so it'd fit better as a loot chest item. Leather horse armor can still be crafted with 7 leather, however. It was first added to PE and Windows 10 Edition on June 13, 2016, gradually being added to other versions before finally being added to Java Edition in the 1.14 update.

Ghasts Firing at the Camera - Prior to Beta 1.7, Ghasts would actually shoot fireballs at the camera instead of the player, allowing one to easily avoid their attack by simply going into third person mode.

Ancient Debris is Fossilized Trees - The texture for ancient debris seems to have bark on the sides and rings on top, suggesting that it may have been the petrified/fossilized remains of some durable species of ancient trees. The texture could also simply be pillar blocks from long-forgotten buildings made entirely of Netherite.

Squid Milking - In Java Edition Beta, from 1.2_01 on January 14th 2011 to 1.4 on March 31st, Squids could be milked with an empty bucket just like cows.

Guardians are Mechanical - There's a lot of things that suggest that Guardians were most likely created by some other species. They have retractable spikes that make them seem like sea mines, they're made of prismarine, they shoot lasers from their eyes, and their only purpose is to guard the Ocean Monuments. The same species that created the Guardians likely also created the Monuments. Furthermore, the official Mobestiary seems confirm that Guardians are made of mechanical parts. 
(Also See: Ghasts are Mechanical)

Modified Jungle Edge - The rarest biome in the game, when a Jungle biome borders a Swamp Hills biome. Whereas Mushroom Islands make up roughly 0.056% of the overworld, Modified Jungle Edges make up a mere 0.00027% of the world. Due to a change in overworld terrain generation in 1.18, Modified Jungle Edges have been removed to be merged with regular Jungle biomes.

Zombie Virus - A theory that claims that an airborne zombie plague/virus has been ravaging the vast majority of the overworld, based on an observation of nether mobs such as piglins and hoglins quickly turning zombified by simply being in the overworld. Over time, natural immunities to the zombie virus were developed to varying degrees, with others discovering cures within the safety of secluded igloo bunkers (See: Zombie Villager Conversion). Not only does this attempt to explain how almost all of humanity was taken out so quickly with Steve still being perfectly fine, it also explains why most villagers simply die upon being attacked by a zombie rather than turning into one themselves, since they've built up a resistance to zombification.

Wake Up (him.html) - During a stream with Brocraft streamer Patimuss where he saw Herobrine in a pool of lava, another streamer named Copeland posted links in chat leading to this website. All that’s on the page is a gif of Steve’s head with frantically moving eyeballs, as well as a mess of symbols and letters. By connecting only the letters, you get the Wake Up messages, which says that victims of torture can sometimes retreat into a fantasy world from which they cannot wake up.

FIFTH LAYER:

Gray Tabby Cat - In the Bedrock Edition of the game, the texture file for a gray tabby cat exists. This texture is completely unused, and can't be spawned in-game.

Snooper - A feature Mojang used (and is still using) to collect data on users, either by the Client or by the Server. It was first introduced on July 23rd, 2012, with the ability to opt out, but was disabled in 1.13 and removed entirely in 1.14 in order to comply with the EU's GDPR privacy laws. Telemetry via Snooper was brought back in 1.18 however, the claimed reason being to "find where the biggest problems in the game were", with no option to opt out.

Indev House - When players started a map in the Indev version of Minecraft, their spawn location was always in a 7x7 house made of mossy cobblestone, a block that couldn’t be acquired naturally anywhere else. These houses contained chests filled with a full stack of every block and item in the game (a stack used to be 99 items). In later versions, these chests were removed, and the houses were updated to be made of planks and have a floor made of stone.

12marc40awesome - A joke drawing Mojang dev Marc Watson made in MS Paint and posted to Twitter on October 4th, 2012. It depicts volcanoes with lava tubes, "MOAR DRAGONZ!", coral, fish mobs, and fish blocks. Coral and fish mobs were added into the game during the Update Aquatic in Java 1.13.

Alpha Snow Worlds - "Winter Mode" was a randomly occurring map type that turned the entire world snowy, technically acting as the first biome in Minecraft besides regular plains. Besides snowfall, oceans were frozen over and animals spawned less frequently. 

RubyDung - An unreleased game Notch made before Minecraft, based on Dwarf Fortress. The name stood for Rubylands Dungeons, Rubylands being the game world that Notch envisioned. The grass and cobblestone textures in that game were later reused in Minecraft, as Notch tried to make a first-person version of the game. 
(Also See: Legend of the Chambered, Zombie Town, Cave Game)

2018 China Mob Vote - From September 7th to September 20th, 2018, Mojang held a vote for players of Minecraft China to choose their favorite "national treasure" to make it into the game. The choices were between the Giant Panda, Alligator, Golden Monkey, White-Lipped Deer, and White Dolphin. The Giant Panda won with 466,490 votes, and was announced at MINECON Earth on September 29th 2018.

Full-Block Chests - When chests were first introduced during Indev on January 24th, 2010, they were considered a solid block. The block model was shrunk for Beta 1.8 on September 9th 2011, as part of a "chest update" which also included an opening animation, proper rotational placement, and generation in mineshafts and strongholds.

MATTIS Crafting Menu - A crafting system used by Pocket Edition Alpha, short for Minecraft Advanced Touch Technology Interface System. The crafting menu is pretty similar to the Recipe Book in modern versions of Minecraft, with a grid of items showcasing what the player can make using the items in their inventory. This crafting menu didn’t have enough space to show every item in the game if the player uses a crafting table, and as a result many blocks had to be moved to other crafting blocks (such as the old stonecutter for stone-type blocks).
(Also See: Old Stonecutter)

Dolphin “Animal Cruelty” - Mojang refused to add the ability to make dolphins rideable, claiming that it was animal cruelty, even though pigs have been rideable for so many years. Sharks won't get into the game for more or less the same reasons (one of the reasons is that Mojang believes it would lead people to believe sharks in the real world are hostile), though that makes sense since all hostile mobs currently in the game are fantasy-based. Why Mojang doesn't want dolphins to be rideable is still a mystery, however… (See: China Appeasement) 

Footsteps - A particle that was introduced in beta 1.5, though it was never used. It could still be created via command blocks, however. The particle was removed in 1.13 due to The Flattening. Footsteps were immortalized as part of the April Fool’s Day 2020 Infinity Update, inside a chest guarded by iron golems. There’s another easter egg in this dimension, as underneath the stairs leading to the chest is a sign saying “This Is Not A Sign”, as a reference to the phrase “Ceci Ne Pas Une Pipe” (or “This Is Not A Pipe”) in René Magritte’s The Treachery Of Images, depicting a painting of a pipe.

Skull Painting Hill Seed - The Minecraft terrain in the background of the Skull on Fire painting actually comes from a real Minecraft world, which was found by a user named Kminster on September 10, 2020. The world is from before 1.1.2 and the seed is -1044887956651363087, or -6984854390176336655, since both seeds result in the same world. The coordinates are x = -250, z = -30. A detailed description of the entire process of finding the seed can be found here.
(Also See: pack.png, Title Screen Seed)

MogMiner Mindcrack Incident - TheMogMiner, AKA Ryan Holtz, was a game developer at Mojang working on the rendering engine for Minecraft. On 18 December 2013, TheMogMiner joined an unaffiliated Mindcrack server assuming it was the official one, then promptly released his anger both in the server and on Twitter when he didn’t receive his proper donator ranks, since he donated $500 to Guude (head of the Mindcrack community) prior to joining. Chat logs seem to show him swearing at mods and using his Mojang status to demand for server ranks. Sometime around January 29, 2015, TheMogMiner was no longer an employee at Mojang.

China Appeasement - Some people speculate that the reasons sharks aren't getting added to Minecraft, and dolphins aren't being made rideable (See: Dolphin “Animal Cruelty”), is in order to appease China, as the Chinese River Dolphin is critically endangered and China launched a massive campaign in 2011 to spread awareness on shark fin consumption in attempts to reduce the number of sharks killed for their fins. Alongside the fact that Minecraft China is a free version of Bedrock Minecraft with a whopping 300 million players (there's only 180 million paid copies everywhere else in the world), it makes sense why Mojang would want to cater to this player base a bit more.

MCPE Xperia Play - The first ever release of Minecraft Pocket Edition was on the Xperia Play via Google Play on August 16th, 2011. An Android release wasn't made until October 7th, and Pocket Edition didn't come to iOS until November 17th.

Anti-Semitic Villager Caricatures - A rumor that villagers (and subsequently villages) are rife with anti-semitic Jewish stereotypes, such as long noses, an obsession with greed via emeralds, and the inclusion of the Iron Golem as a guardian, since golems as protectors trace their origins back to Jewish texts. It's not exactly confirmed whether this is explicitly the case; not only has Microsoft continued to include their original design in Minecraft, but villagers themselves were claimed by Notch to be inspired by the villagers from Dungeon Master II, a game which had inspired earlier projects of his as well (See: Legend of the Chambered)... Albeit as part of a Twitter thread where Notch goes along with an anti-semitic dogwhistle.

Green Shrubs - A type of shrub/deadbush added in 1.5, with a tinted green color that varied in saturation depending on the biome. Green shrubs were gradually phased out starting in 1.8, before being removed completely in 1.13.

Mars Effect - A hoax website Notch created for April Fool's Day 2012. The name is intentionally a play on Mass Effect, a BioWare game. This was a reference to Bethesda (another video game company) filing a lawsuit against Mojang for their earlier game Scrolls, which had a similar name to Bethesda's game series The Elder Scrolls. Mars Effect eventually turned out to be a real game under a different title: 0x10c.

Friends List - A feature in Minecraft Pocket Edition and Minecraft Bedrock, allowing players to invite people to servers they have created. Kris Jelbring announced that he was working on a friends list for Mojang back in June 2013, even though such a feature still hasn’t been introduced to Java Edition.

Farther Lands - The second set of Far Lands that generated 80x further than the first set, at 1,004,065,811 blocks away from spawn. Antvenom made a video on it in 2018. 
Even further sets of Far Lands exist, aptly named the Fartherer and Farthest lands at 53,905,378,846,979,747 and 4,312,430,307,758,379,832 blocks away respectively. These can't be viewed in a normal world, however, due to the chunk overwrite limit occurring 34,359,738,368 blocks away and the block rendering limit occurring 2,147,483,647 blocks away, meaning players have to modify the noise generator in order to view them.

Rare Clay - In Beta 1.6, clay would only generate underwater when the x- and z- coordinates were the same, meaning clay would often be incredibly hard to come by.

Indev Map Customization - The Indev map generation gave players multiple options for maps. “Long” and “Deep” map shapes made your world twice as long or twice as high, respectively. Besides the normal map theme, one could create a “Hell” map where all water was replaced with lava, “Paradise” where beaches were bigger and plants were more abundant, and lastly “Woods” where trees generated much more frequently in the world. There were different map types, too. “Inland” had infinite hilly terrain, “Island” surrounded a landmass with water on all sides, “Floating” created floating islands much like the ones in the current Buffet world type, and “Flat” was essentially the predecessor to Superflat.
(Also see: Death Island)

Ravagers are Mutated Villagers - Ravager mobs share quite a few similarities with Minecraft Villagers, including green eyes, a unibrow, and a tendency to make grunting noises. One theory states that pillagers take prisoners from their raids in order to mutilate them into killing machines. Ravagers could also simply be the Pillagers' version of Iron Golems, though they don't drop iron nuggets like they do. 
(Also see: Woodland Mansion Cult) 

Snow QR Code - The Love and Hugs Update for April Fool’s Day 2015 hid a QR code within its version. Near x = 0 and z = 0, there is a patch of land where some blocks would never have snow fall on them. This area eventually formed the shape of a QR code, which when scanned said “Minecraft 1.9: The Combat Update”, teasing the upcoming update at the time.

Calibrated Sculk Sensor - An unused top and side texture for a block that seems to depict a sculk sensor with some sort of amethyst slab resting on top of it.
2023 UPDATE: This block has been added now, so it's no longer unused, lmao.

Portal Activation Patterns - Every interdimensional portal in Minecraft follows the same pattern of a ring of hard material having heat exposed to it. Nether portals are made of obsidian and require a flint and steel, whereas End Portals are made of indestructible frames and are positioned above a pit of lava. Even the End Gate is made of bedrock, and is activated once the dragon explodes above it.

Infinite Lava Source - Back in Indev, a block called the Infinite Lava Source was added to player inventories as well as chests in the Indev House (See: Indev House), alongside the Infinite Water Source. These blocks would infinitely spread in every way but up. If left uncontained, the blocks could replicate to massive amounts.

Droopy Likes Your Face - A song in Alpha Minecraft with some strange audio samples, taken from a text-to-speech reader by Texas Instruments called the Magic Wand Speak & Learn, which could scan barcodes to read certain children’s books out loud, including a book called “The Droopy Dragon” . Other Droopy-Related songs by C418 include Droopy Likes Ricochet and Droopy Remembers.

ashes2ashes - A creepypasta involving two audio files found in an unassuming folder during the 2010 Halloween Update: ashes1ashes.ogg and ashes2ashes.ogg. The first clip only has clicking, but the second clip seems to be of a man sobbing.

Isometric Screenshot - In the Indev versions of Minecraft, pressing F7 would allow you to take an isometric screenshot of the map, rendering mobs as well as any changes made to the world. There were a couple bugs with this though; for one, the player would only be rendered if you were in third person beforehand, and blocks were only rendered if they were in your field of vision.

"Nothing to solve" - there's a hidden book in the “Llama” Dimension of the Infinity Update that only says "Nothing to solve."

0-Tick Farms - 0-Tick Pulses were a bug that allowed a redstone signal to turn on and off in the same tick. One simple way to make a 0-tick machine would’ve been to have a repeater powering a block and a comparator activating a piston to move the block, depowering it in the process. Since comparators are prioritized after repeaters, the output will first turn on and then off, all in the same tick. When activating a piston using a 0-tick pulse, pushed blocks are essentially teleported instantly, which also allowed dirt to be moved under crops without them popping off. 
This could’ve been exploited for farms. Minecraft’s code for crops contained a single procedure that both determined when to go to the next growth stage, as well as check if the block under it is dirt. By using a 0-tick piston to constantly move dirt blocks under these crops, the check procedure occurred, but this also tricked them into going to the next growth stage, thus making incredibly fast farms. While the 0-tick bug's application in fast growing was fixed in 1.16, 0-tick mechanisms themselves still work.

Shadow Seeds - All Java seeds have a shadow, or a 2nd seed that shares the exact same biome map, but different terrain generation and different structure locations. AntVenom made a video on it on July 18, 2020.

Wool Armor - In Indev, before leather armor was a thing, Cloth Armor could be crafted from wool. The texture for this armor set was taken from one of Notch’s earlier games, Legend of the Chambered (See: Legend of the Chambered).

72 DaQa Accounts - There used to be 72 accounts with the same name, DaQa. All of them except one have since been deleted, however. One theory is that DaQa stands for Dev Account Quality Assurance, though there's no official explanation.

Fluff.png - A fluffy texture that was intended to be used for clouds in Infdev, though it was removed in early Alpha.

Lapis-Powered Statues - Blocks of lapis lazuli, the ore required to use enchanting tables, can be found inside Illager Heads made of wool inside Woodland Mansions.
(Also See: Woodland Mansion Cult) 

Alpha 1.1.1 - The 10th and final "Seecret Update" version released by Notch on September 18th, 2010. Whereas the previous 9 were released on Fridays, this one was released on Saturday. This update added sneaking, fishing rods, and new paintings. It was only available for 205 minutes as a result of a one line bug causing the screen to go gray as a result of gamma and contrast values being set to 0, and was quickly fixed in Alpha 1.1.2. This update is notable for having no known archives, up until twitter user LunaSorcery provided an archived .jar file.

Minecraft 4K - A version of Minecraft made in December 2009 for the 2010 Java 4K contest, which challenged programmers to make a game using just 4 kibibytes, or 4096 bytes, of data. For reference, Java Edition in its current state is 180 megabytes, or 180,000,000 bytes, excluding storage taken up by worlds which can increase this by several additional gigabytes. Only six blocks exist in this version: grass, dirt, stone, bricks, leaves, and wood.

South-East Rule - Also known as the Z-X rule, since South denotes positive Z changes and East denotes positive X changes (prior to Beta 1.9-Pre4, West was positive X), this is an unintentional mechanic where choices made by the game favor the south or east directions. When placed at an intersection causing them to curve, rails will curve to the south or east; any mob initially spawned into the world, including the player, will always face south; TNT cannons fire farther on average while facing east or south; a bug often led to villagers cramming into the same house on the south-eastern part of the village; levers placed on the floors of ceiling will initially point towards the south or east; and before Beta 1.6, dispensers used to shoot through solid blocks in the south or west directions until that was patched out.

Exploding Arrows - In the documentary "Minecraft: The Story Of Mojang" released in 2012, Notch shows off his ability to debug Minecraft's code while playing the game at the same time. In that same scene, he also manages to code in exploding arrows for fun. Exploding arrows aren't a feature planned to be added into the game, although arrows that explode are partially a thing with the ability to shoot firework rockets out of crossbows.

Elytra Origins - Elytra is the term for the hardened forewings, commonly found on bugs such as beetles, that cover the actual wings, though they can still be used for gliding. The wings in Minecraft may have rotted away due to how delicate they are, leaving only the outer shell. Phantoms may be the evolved version (or at least a descendant) of the beetles that Elytra came from, since the wings can be repaired with Phantom membranes. However, this must mean that Phantoms are real manifestations rather than hallucinations generated via insomnia.

banananana.ogg - In the Minecraft Infinity Update for April Fool’s Day 2020, there’s a file called banananana.ogg that’s a high-pitched version of the sound used in the Mojang splash screen. It’s found in a folder called “nothingtoseeheremovealong”.

Vexes are Corrupted Allays - Allays are legless blue spirit-themed mobs, incredibly similar to Vexes, right down to the texture of their wings. The only big difference is that Allays are passive whereas Vexes are hostile. One could speculate that Vexes are a result of Evokers capturing and corrupting Allays for their own gain.

Stabby McStabface - The "Isolation" dimension of the Minecraft Infinity update is home to a single villager, Bob, and his 3 dogs (with collars in each of the 3 RGB colors). Signs placed outside his house say "INGEN REKLAM TACK!" (Swedish for "NO ADVERTISEMENT PLEASE!") and "GO AWAY!". A hidden chest underneath his home contains rotten flesh, bones, and a sword named "Stabby McStabface", suggesting that Bob may have used this sword to murder and bury someone. It could have been a second inhabitant to the dimension, or a visitor.

Unused Chair Texture - Notch's old blog showed that he intended to add chairs to Minecraft alongside doors, ladders, and signs. Two chair textures were also added in the files, for the side view and front view. These textures were removed a few months later.

skis.png - A texture for a pair of skis that was added in the 1.4.6 update on December 20, 2012 (though it was also included in snapshots dating back to April 2012). They were referenced by Dinnerbone on Twitter, though he also implied that the skis were simply a joke addition (“They’re attached to a rouge fish”, AKA a red herring).

Early Mob Designs - Throughout Minecraft's history, Mojang revealed several prototype designs for mobs that didn't make the cut. Pillagers were going to look like pirates at first, with eyepatches and tattered orange clothes. Ravagers were originally called "Illager Beasts", boasting far taller legs as well as completely blank eyes.
Bees were originally pretty small as well. Deciding that size wasn't cute enough, bees were made larger, albeit with a more realistic appearance.
When phantoms were first introduced, they kept the design they had in the mob vote teaser; that is, short and blocky wings. They even had a mouth before that was scrapped. Over the next few snapshots, phantoms were made far more detailed. Before taking up a blue theme, Phantoms were originally red, although this was scrapped since it made them look too much like a Nether mob.
Striders went through the biggest changes. They originally looked like a completely different mob, almost tardigrade-like in design, before being tweaked to something more familiar. First having 9, then 6 legs, they were eventually cut down to 2-legged Striders.
Additionally, Drowned mobs were originally pink and Wandering Traders originally had emeralds and hats on their head before settling on a hood.
(Also See: Unused Pigmen, Zombified Piglin Green Blood, Enderman Green Eyes, Brown Spiders)

Alex's Glasses - When Alex was first added into the game in version 1.8, a hidden Alex face with glasses on was hidden in the texture file as a reference to Jeb (one of Minecraft's developers).

Dungeons and Levers - The former name for Adventure mode, announced by Notch while the game was still in Alpha as a gamemode that'll be available once the game is complete. Unlike the Adventure mode we have today, Notch hinted at four players to compete, permadeath like in Hardcore mode making it rogue-like in nature, and a quest system with randomly generated maps/quests.

Steve is a God - How is Steve able to carry so much in his inventory without losing speed? How can he jump a whole meter effortlessly, and run almost twice as fast as the average person like it was nothing? Why is he the only one of his kind in this World? How can he go from absolutely nothing to slaying a cosmic being in the vacuum of space in a matter of just days? How can he punch wood???


SIXTH LAYER:

"Rescue a Ghast from the Nether" - The wording from the description of the Uneasy Alliance advancement makes it sound like Ghasts are involuntarily trapped in the Nether, or that they do not belong there.
(Also See: Ghasts are Soul Amalgamations)

Legend of the Chambered - A retro-styled first-person RPG created by Notch sometime before May 27, 2008, inspired by games such as Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder. The old texture for leather armor, as well as the textures for the apple, iron sword, and quiver (See: Quiver), were all taken from this game. There’s also Prelude of the Chambered, which Notch made in 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 21 competition in August 2011.
(Also See: Zombie Town, RubyDung)

Flower Forest Gradient - Every block in a flower forest can only have a specific type of flower on it when spawned via bone meal. Oddly enough, these don’t match the flower pattern that is created on world generation. The bone meal pattern seems to be following Perlin noise, a popular random noise generator for creating realistic terrain, though Minecraft uses Fractal noise for its worlds instead (Also See: Far Lands).
For plains and sunflower plains, a more subtle gradient occurs. Some blocks only allow tulips to spawn while others only allow non-tulips to spawn, creating a noise pattern of tulips vs non-tulips (although it's not technically a gradient since there's only two states).

Worlds Have 7 Seeds - THIS DESCRIPTION IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
In the meantime, have a look at this video explaining the concept:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbGUHAUfpv4

Debug.png - One of two textures added during Java 1.9 on July 29th, 2015. Debug.png shows a rainbow gradient behind a lattice of black dots, whereas the other texture (named debug2.png) depicts the symbols n, m, 3, and s over red, green, blue, and yellow gradients respectively. These textures were mainly used for debugging purposes, as their name describes. In certain snapshots of 1.13, for instance, debug.png was used as the dust particle texture for bubble columns. By falling just on the edge of a block near a bubble column, or by pushing said column with a piston, the debug.png texture in the form of particles would be visible.

Hollow World - Despite being 8 times the size of the Earth (going off of natural world border size), the Minecraft player doesn’t experience 8 G’s of force. In fact, gravity is arguably less than it is on Earth, explaining how Steve can effortlessly jump meter-high blocks and run without tiring. The reason for the reduced gravity is most likely because a vast majority of the world is actually hollow. The Earth’s crust is 35 kilometers thick and the distance to the center of the Earth is 6,371 kilometers, but the distance from Minecraft’s sea level to bedrock is a mere 62 meters. The void (See: Void Below Bedrock) may not actually be a bottomless pit, but a large expanse of darkness in the middle of a massive artificial planet.

Triple Chests - In Beta 1.1_02 on December 22nd, 2010, a patch was created to stop a purely visual chest connection bug in Indev on January 24th of that year. However, this brought with it an unintentional side effect of making functional triple chests (as well as quadruple and quintuple chests) possible. 
By placing another chest vertically adjacent to an existing double chest, thus creating an "L" shape, or by placing a chest connected anywhere to a double chest via placing it inside of a water source block (abusing a bug from July 2010 that skips a check to see if the current block placement is valid), the chest in the middle would gain a corrupted GUI but a fully working expanded storage. 
This process could be repeated 2 more times to create a cross shape of 5 chests, with the middle chest having 5 times as much storage as a regular single chest (the size of the GUI makes it impossible to transfer items from your inventory into it, however).
This bug was patched in Beta 1.5 on April 19th, 2011. New glitched chests couldn't be created by the player, but existing ones could still work. Additionally, natural generation or commands could still create glitched chests, until that too was patched in 1.13.

Zombie Town - An old game by Notch, made sometime around October 30, 2009. It was meant as a sequel to Left 4k Dead, a game Notch made for the 2009 Java 4K Contest (Also See: Minecraft 4K) that actually won. The only footage of the game shows humans (later repurposed as Minecraft Steve) frolicking around in an empty field. The Minecraft zombie likely also came from this game.
(Also See: Legend of the Chambered, RubyDung)

Minecraft 4D - An April Fool's video Notch planned on releasing in 2010, but was unable to due to moving into a new home.

Oceans/Mountains As Structures - When oceans and mountains were first introduced, they were treated as structures, breaking up other "true" biomes whenever needed. They weren't made into real biomes until the Beta 1.8 Prerelease on September 9th, 2011.

Pumpkins Contain Souls - A theory that the reason Snow Golems and Iron Golems immediately come to life after placing a pumpkin on their head is because they're imbued with souls, or at the very least soul energy. All naturally spawning pumpkins prior to 1.13 had faces carved into them, which could suggest that they’re much more than just regular pumpkins.

Enderman Green Eyes - Endermen originally had green eyes when they were first added to the game during the Beta 1.8 Pre-Release on September 9th 2011. On September 13th 2011, however, during an update officially referred to as "Java Edition Beta 1.8 Pre-release 2 ;)", their eye color was changed from green to purple.

SCP-4335 - An SCP article about an anomalous entity that was found in a Minecraft world a week after the first Alpha version. It is pure black, with tendrils protruding from its back. The SCP is contained in a series of cubes made of four layers of iron blocks and a layer of obsidian in the middle. It consumes the loot generated from mob farms located around the cubes, keeping it immobile (as it cannot move while consuming). In the event SCP-4335 attempts to breach its containment center, the ceiling breaks open to release lava. Looking at SCP-4335 may cause your perception of reality to be altered. SCP-4335 is an eldritch abomination from a higher plane that wishes to get rid of creation. Since SCP-4335 defines creation as something made by a sapient being, the entity wasn't able to see our world; it only saw the virtual world. Endermen were later added to Minecraft.

Mineshafts Ignore Ores - Even though the main purpose of a mineshaft is, well, for mining, all of them seem to completely ignore the ores around them. This suggests that these tunnels weren't created for collecting resources; they may have been used for transportation, or possibly to quickly hide from an unknown danger on the surface. Almost all of the mineshafts are empty.

Steve Villager Hybrid - After villagers were added, a texture file could be found that seemed to combine the skin of Steve with the body of a Villager. It was removed in 1.5.

Searge's QR Codes - A series of 1.9 teaser screenshots by Searge included 5 hidden fragments of a QR code hidden throughout the images. When put together, it revealed a steam code for Indie Game: The Movie.

Ghost Blocks - For several versions of Minecraft up until Java 1.13, certain redstone contraptions involving slime blocks would allow glitched client-only ghost blocks to be formed infinitely. These blocks break instantly and drop nothing, and are considered nonexistent by the server, but are visible and even able to be collided with by the player (until they reload their game). This made for some interesting mob-proof bridge applications until it was patched, although it saw a short return in 1.15-1.16 with honey blocks and again in 1.17 with powder snow.

Human Mobs - A spawnable mob version of Steve that existed from Pre-Classic to Classic. They were named “monsters” in the code. While walking, they would flail their arms randomly. In later versions, they had the ability to attack the player.

Block 36 - Also known as piston_extension (and moving_piston in 1.13 onwards), this block is a side effect of storing moving blocks as tile entities rather than regular entities. It can be acquired using commands and placed, with weird results. When placed next to another block in the world, it appears pure black, but otherwise it's fully transparent and has no collision (although it does slightly decrease the light level of light passing through it). The block is also indestructible by left-clicking, but can be removed by simply right-clicking on it once.

0x10c - A planned followup to Minecraft in the process of development by Notch and Mojang between 2012 and 2013, intended to be some sort of space trading simulator. 0x10c denotes a hexadecimal number equal to 16^12 in decimal (281,474,976,710,656), which is how many years had passed since 1988 in the game's story. The game was put on hold and cancelled a year after it first began development.

Vexes are Lost Souls - Vexes, the winged creatures spawned by Evokers, may actually be souls trapped and forced to fight against their will. While summoning a mob usually means creating it out of thin air, to evoke (in the context of the paranormal) is to call upon a spirit or deity, suggesting that Vexes have already existed prior to being called upon. While it could be argued that Vexes are part of some sort of demonic army acquired through a pact (See: Woodland Mansion Cult), the other likely explanation could be that they’re the souls of villagers slain during raids (See: Ravagers are Mutated Villagers).

Unused Ghast Scream - Ghasts have a sound called “Affectionate Scream”, that was added in 1.1 but never used. The sound is much more high-pitched than other cries. Wolves also have two unused howling noises.

Wandering Traders are Nitwits - The undershirt of a Wandering Trader is green, matching that of a Nitwit's shirt. It's likely that some Nitwits left their villages to find their true calling, selling exotic goods from rare locals. Their poor trades may be a result of laziness, or below-average intelligence. It's also likely that they're just scam artists, but a Nitwit may not be smart enough to even attempt such a thing.

Obsidian Walls - A 2-block high obsidian structure that generated along the X and Z axes during Infdev. It only existed from February 27 to March 13, 2010.

Ghasts are Mechanical - According to a diagram in the official Mobestiary, Ghasts have an internal mechanism that allows them to shoot fireballs.

entity.hanging - The most likely answer is that entity.hanging was the original designation name for the sounds leads made when they were placed and broken, though these sounds were removed in 1.9. Then again, "entity.hanging.place" was added at the same time as "entity.leashknot.place", so maybe not.

Metal Ores Dropped Metal Blocks - When Iron and Gold ore were added in the 0.26 SURVIVAL TEST on October 24th, 2009, they originally dropped 1-3 iron or gold blocks respectively, since actual ingots weren't implemented by then. Additionally, Coal ore used to drop 1-3 stone slabs instead.

Brown Spiders - While spiders were in development for their release in 0.26 SURVIVAL TEST on October 24th, 2009, they originally had a brown texture instead of black like they do nowadays. The texture change from brown to black actually happened roughly 28 minutes before the release of this version, because of a suggestion by user Xion on the TIGSource forums.

Bedrock Debug Builds - In the Windows 10/11 edition of the game, UWP debug builds of the game exist with a wide variety of technical shortcuts and F3 displays. Although these builds are generally kept secret, they're generally given out to Marketplace developers in order to test out content.

Enchanting Table is Futuristic Technology - The text for the Enchanting Table is the Standard Galactic Alphabet (See: Enchantment Text), suggesting that it's some sort of futuristic tech. 

Early Creeper Behavior - When creepers were first introduced in Java Edition Classic on September 1st, 2009, they simply hopped around randomly until they spotted the player, delivering 4 hearts' worth of damage on contact. They didn't explode until they were killed. It wasn't until Indev on February 4th 2010 that their behavior was changed to the one we know today.

White Endermen - The concept of white endermen gained popularity with a creepypasta of an enderman with inverted colors chasing a player and avoiding death in absurd ways (including walking on top of water in order to avoid damage), eventually permanently killing the player despite the world not being in hardcore mode. Although the creepypasta itself isn't true, white endermen sightings themselves might have some merit to them; texture issues may cause an enderman to spawn with completely white skin (albeit with normal purple eyes) since white is often the default color used to substitute for transparent/nonexistent pixels wherever they're required. Having only a single enderman out of many receive this texture error seems implausible, however.

Warped Forest Help Sounds - Some ambience sounds in the Warped Forest biome have the name “Warped Forest Help” and “Warped Forest Here”, showing odd Enderman noises and sounds of distress. It's likely that they're attempting to communicate to the player about something, much like they already do with their backwards speech (See: Endermen Backwards Speech). Another piece of ambience is Warped Forest mood9, which seems to play back slowed down laughter.
(Also See: Ender Dragon Enslaved Endermen)

OldRoot - An ARG that started on the Minecraft subreddit in 2014 by u/OldRoot, that is still unsolved to this day. A full history of what has been solved so far can be found here.
On RetroGamingNow's video covering the OldRoot mystery, Alex Bale revealed himself to be the original creator of the OldRoot ARG.


SEVENTH LAYER:

Old Dragon Respawn Method - In snapshot 15w31a of 1.9, before an official way to resummon the Ender Dragon was added (by placing four ender crystals along the portal well), one could bring the dragon back by making a creeper face out of clay along the north-south axis.

Basalt Deltas Radiation - Ambience sounds in the Basalt Deltas biome include clicking noises, which sound very similar to the sounds of Geiger Counters. These sounds could potentially imply that the biome is radioactive. In addition, the ash particles found in the biome could instead be some sort of radioactive fallout, rather than volcanic ash (or it could be a mix of the two). The presence of further ambience explicitly described as being from explosions, possibly nuclear explosions, could also support this theory, although they could also simply be volcanic eruptions.

calm4 - An upbeat synth tune that was added in Alpha v1.1.1, but removed in Alpha v1.1.2. Around 1:36, Notch can be heard saying “Mojang Specifications” but sped down. Mojang Specifications was the former full name of Mojang from 2009 to 2010.

Shared Bedrock Pattern - In Java Edition, the pattern of the bedrock floor underneath the Overworld is the same in every world regardless of seed, though in Bedrock Edition it’s only the Nether Ceiling that is consistent (See: Nether Ceiling). This consistent pattern can be exploited, as has been done in 2b2t, to pinpoint the coordinates of a base through a picture of just a few blocks of bedrock. A similar exploit can also be done on netherrack; the game rotates the block textures to make patterns seem more natural, though the orientation is dependent on location. As of 1.18, the pattern generation of the bedrock layer is now dependent on the world seed.

Emerald Sickness - A theory that the Illagers and Pillagers came about by them becoming so greedy for emeralds that they'd rather kill one another, twisting the mind and the soul in the process.

Death Island - In Minecraft Indev, creating a world with the map type Floating and the map shape Deep (4x the height of a normal map) will spawn you in the air, killing you once you make impact with the ground, since the generator can't find a suitable place to spawn your starting house (See: Indev House). The same bug seems to happen with the Island and Inland map types, too.

Gray Prototype Creepers - A picture of early prototype creepers (the result of a mistake causing the pig model to have a body that’s taller than it was long) was posted by Notch on August 31, 2009. The texture on the models appears to be some sort of desaturated clay or sand, or perhaps a new texture entirely.
(Also See: Creeper Origins)

Birds Screaming - An audio loop that was added into the Classic version of Minecraft on May 28, 2009. It was intended to be played when the player was in a forest. Though forests in real life often have birds chirping, Minecraft didn't have any birds (with the exception of chickens) until parrots were added into the game in the 1.12 update. 

air.ogg - Part of a streaming project by boq, a developer at Mojang. It was hosted here. Using SSTV to convert the sounds into an image, you get what's shown in the Layer 7 image on the chart. It's a passphrase that leads you to the 43rd hidden dimension in the Infinity Update (“this_is_a_very_long_phrase_that_hopefully_is_not_in_any_dictionary”).
In this dimension, there is a secret message written in grass blocks that includes the sentence “All these worlds are yours, except Europa*. Use them together. Use them in peace. *Europa™️ the Moon sold separately.” This is a reference to the alien message from 2010: Odyssey Two.

Alpha Slabs & Leaves - Alpha Slabs, also called Wooden Slabs, were an earlier version of wood slabs that existed from Beta 1.3.1 to Beta 1.7.10. They were identical to a stone slab in terms of footstep sound and tool required to break them, as well as invulnerability to fire, except they had the wood plank texture. 
As the game updated, Mojang made a new slab called Oak Wood Slab but left the Alpha Slab ID in the game. As a result, there were identical looking wooden slabs with different IDs for several updates. In 1.8, the Wooden Slab shows a missing texture in the inventory (See: Missing Texture Block). In 1.13, the Wooden Slab texture was brought back, but the name was changed to Petrified Oak Slab, due to its stone slab properties. 
Alpha Leaves have a similar history, with their texture in the inventory being an abnormally large Missing Texture block, obtained by starting a beta 1.2 world, grabbing them with a Silk Touch pick in release 1.0, and then updating to a later version. In 1.13, Alpha Leaves were converted to regular Oak Leaves.

Guardians Are Sentient Conduits - The heart of the sea, for starters, isn't a literal heart but an eye; its item texture depicts closed eyelids, and the effect icon for Conduit Power depicts the opened version of the eyeball with a red pupil. In order to activate a conduit, it must be surrounded by prismarine blocks. What are guardians? A mob with a single red eye surrounded by prismarine. Additionally, guardians don't suffocate out of water, potentially hinting towards them being air-breathing entities with some form of water breathing—an effect provided via Conduit Power.

Bonus Chest Duplication Glitch - In early console editions of Minecraft (around 2013-2014), the bonus chest generated at the start of the world (if enabled) could be duplicated infinitely by simply breaking the chest and exiting out of and back into the world again, where it would regenerate once more. 

Steve is an Amnesiac - A theory based off of the assumption that crafting recipes and advancements are canon information, and are actually the thoughts of Steve himself. At some point during whatever apocalyptic event caused almost all of mankind to be wiped off the face of the planet, Steve developed amnesia, and over the course of the game specific events cause him to jog his memory and remember more of the survival skills he used to possess. One notable instance is how simply going into water unlocks the crafting recipe for boats, even if the player hasn't actually collected wood yet. 

Item Shadowing - THIS DESCRIPTION IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. 
In the meantime, please have a look at these youtube videos explaining item shadowing:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8_FPyn20ns 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTeYwq7HaEA 

Dead Star - Though there have been post-apocalyptic theories in the past (See: Post-Apocalyptic Future), this theory states that the Minecraft World doesn’t actually take place on Earth at all. Taking place far into the future, where the sun has reached its entropic death, humans decided to create their own artificial sun by turning the Earth into a heat source, while civilization migrated over to the cold remains of the dead Sun to start anew. The artificial planet could explain why the Minecraft world is still abundantly ripe with resources, and why there’s only a few feet of soil above a layer of rock. 
This also explains the weird path of celestial bodies in the night sky, with the "moon" and "sun" always in a circular path perfectly opposite one another, and the stars all orbiting the "earth" at the same pace. These can't be explained if the Minecraft World was orbiting an actual sun, but would make much more sense if we were on the Real sun, and the "moon" and "sun" seen in the game were simply other planets orbiting us.
(Also See: Hollow World)

Old Smelting Method - Smelting was implemented in Indev 0.31 on January 29th 2010, but furnaces weren't added until February 19th 2010. In the time between then, items such as ores could be smelted by throwing them into fire or lava. Coal, iron, gold, and diamond ore could be smelted into 1-3 of their respective materials.

1K IN 24h Edition - For Java Edition Alpha v1.0.13_01, the Minecraft logo on the menu screen was changed to "1K IN 24h" to celebrate 1000 sales in the past 24 hours.

Alternative Redstone - Before redstone was added to Minecraft Pocket Edition, players found ways to create signals using the blocks they had, often sand and cacti. This is because of a mechanic that forces a cactus to pop off if it’s adjacent to another block at any time. By placing a line of signs on top of the cacti, then putting sand blocks on top of the signs, one could make the sand blocks fall down on demand by placing a block next to the cactus. This basic contraption is useful for making falling sand doors, as well as having the sand blocks trigger yet another cactus signal to create a chain of them. 

The Wither is Imperfect - The current Wither is formed with only a few blocks of soul sand and three wither skeleton skulls. That really doesn't seem like much to summon what is apparently an incredibly powerful entity, not to mention the fact that the Wither is just a floating torso without any limbs. Steve probably doesn't know the proper way to summon the "Perfect" Wither, and is instead going off what the Wither painting depicts. Though it’s not canon, Minecraft: Story Mode Season 1’s main antagonist was the Wither Storm, a much stronger version of the Wither summoned with a command block in the middle of the soul sand.

MCPE Crater - Before caves were added to Pocket Edition, a seed called "porsche" generated an incredibly deep crater, complete with a lava waterfall and a lake at the bottom.

Stronghold Debug Glass Towers - In order to test the location of generated end portal rooms in strongholds, Jeb used a pair of glass towers that went all the way up to build height; one marked the entrance to the stronghold, and one marked the location of the portal room itself. When Java Beta 1.9 Pre-3 was released on October 9th, 2011, Jeb forgot to remove these debug towers, so they stayed in the game. They were removed on October 13th, 2011.

Pillagers Created and Armed Piglins - They both have crossbows, for one. This theory could also explain why regular pigs turn into Zombified Piglins when exposed to lightning; Illagers may have experimented on pigs (See: Woodland Mansion Cult) and found out they could make humanoid monsters. After realizing that Zombified Piglins don't make good servants, they were all likely banished to the Nether like it was a garbage bin. 

Mandatory Telemetry - In 1.18, data collection via Minecraft Snooper was brought back after more than 3 years of being disabled. With no ability to opt out, it seems to be violating several EU GDPR rights regarding data privacy and security, a stark contrast from its initial abandonment from 1.13 onwards in order to be compliant with GDPR. 

Mushroom Island Nuclear Tests - Mushroom Islands stand out a lot in terms of overworld biomes. They contain a type of grass (Mycelium) obtainable nowhere else, as well as mutated Mooshroom cows. In addition, no hostile mobs spawn there, giving it a peaceful yet desolate feel. Since these biomes are almost always exclusively islands, it’s likely that these sites were used by earlier civilizations to test nuclear weapons away from the mainland, and the radiation led to extinction and mutation of the species that remained. The mushroom theme of the islands could thus be symbolically linked to the mushroom clouds generated by nuclear explosions. 

MCPE Invisible Fire - When fire was first added to Minecraft Pocket Edition, it was completely invisible, save for the smoke particles it produced. In addition, it had an absurdly high fire spread, and it had the ability to burn up non-flammable blocks such as dirt and stone.

MinecraftEdu - Not to be confused with Education Edition, this was an educational version of Minecraft developed by TeacherGaming on November 5th, 2011. Teacher options were a big draw, as well as a handful of blocks added to limit where students can build, place, go, etc. 
MinecraftEdu was bought by Mojang around January 19th 2016 and subsequently discontinued on April 5th 2016, due to Mojang's own Education Edition being in the works.

Piglins used Ruined Portals and became Zombified - Piglins in the Nether may have created their own obsidian portals in order to explore the Overworld, only to find out that it rots their flesh (See: Zoglin). The Zombified Piglins then went back to their homeworld, destroying the portals on the other side. Where Piglins got the obsidian in the first place, however, is a different question.
(Also See: Pillagers Created And Armed Piglins)

Cold-En Oak - A rare bug in Pocket Edition that causes spruce trees at the edge of a snowy biome to take the shape of an oak tree. Its name is probably a reference to Golden Oak, a species of Oak tree.

Nautilus Theory - A fascinating (although somewhat outlandish) theory that adds on to the concept of Nautiluses being extinct (See: Nautiluses Are Extinct), suggesting that over time they quickly evolved out of their magical shells to avoid being hunted and instead went to fill other ecological niches. Some intensified their conduit power and congregated near abandoned conduit buildings (the ocean monuments), creating a hierarchy system and eventually evolving into the Guardians. Others nestled into cave aquifers, evolving to need less and less water as they relied more on stony minerals and moss, becoming Silverfish. 
Silverfish-based Nautiluses near underground Strongholds with still-activated portals fell through to the other side, becoming corrupted Endermites. With the Ender Dragon now endangered (See: Ancient Builders), Some populations of Endermite evolved to fill the empty ecological niche the dragons once filled, becoming flying Phantoms. 
Being capable of teleportation, evolved Endermites hopped between dimensions whenever an opportunity arose, although this did meant they would constantly get trapped in certain dimensions. those stuck in the Nether eventually became Striders, living in lava pools as a byproduct of descending from aquatic creatures, whereas Phantoms were among those who primarily settled down in the Overworld.

Afrikaans Singleplayer Slur - Sometime around January 27th, 2012, upon switching to the Afrikaans language, players were greeted with the phrase "You are a N*****" in place of the Singleplayer button on the title screen. Mojang quickly apologized shortly after, chalking it up to a "prankster" that abused Crowdin (the crowdsourced translation tool the game draws from).

Pre-Classic Censored Videos - Notch created a tech test for Cave Game (See: Cave Game) on May 13, 2009, though it's blocked in most countries for unknown reasons. The rest of the videos on his channel (Nizzotch) seem to be censored too. Here's an archive of Notch's old videos.


EIGHTH LAYER:

Ghasts Are Soul Amalgamations - With Ghasts being ghost-like mobs (assuming you don't take the Ghasts Are Mechanical theory as true), one could wonder which mob once existed that could be big enough to become Ghasts upon death yet no longer exist in a living form today. One theory proposes that ghasts aren't actually based on one singular mob, but are simply the runoff of souls produced once soul sand blocks become too saturated. This explains why Ghasts have a higher spawn rate in Soul Sand Valleys, where soul sand and soul soil are far more prominent. It also somewhat explains the depressed nature of Ghasts as well as clarifying the description of the "Uneasy Alliance" advancement (See: "Rescue a Ghast From The Nether"), since they do not actually belong in the Nether in the first place, many times containing the ghosts of fallen adventurers.

Soul Sand Valley White Pumpkins - A rumor when the Nether Update first came out, claiming that soul soil was able to be tilled, producing a new crop called White Pumpkins as a nod to Minecraft: Story Mode.

Ancient Debris came from a Reactor Explosion - A theory stating that instead of Debris being ancient trees (See: Ancient Debris is Fossilized Trees), the debris is actually the metal scraps from the aftermath of a huge reactor explosion that subsequently gave birth to the Nether dimension, much like the Nether Reactor Core from the early Pocket Edition days but on a much larger scale. If this reactor dealt with nuclear materials, it would also explain the potential radioactive fallout subtheme of the Basalt Deltas (See: Basalt Deltas Radiation) 

Beacons Release Souls - Beacons require a nether star to be crafted, found within the core of the Wither; a hideous fusion of soul sand and once-undead wither skulls. Nether stars on their own are a strange thing to be dropped by this boss, although it makes more sense if one were to assume that these stars are simply the concentrated essence of all the souls that made up the Wither previously. By creating the proper structure, one could break apart this star and release the souls within, sending them upwards towards the afterlife as one large column of light. Beacon effects are a final thank you to those you saved; a blessing in exchange for an extraordinarily good deed.

1.RV Data Collection - A rumor about the 1.RV April Fools update (See: 1.RV-Pre1), saying that a lot of the features from the update (especially the Ankle Monitor) were experimental ways to test out data collection on players, and that there was even more data outside of the features that were being explicitly displayed to the player, with methods encrypted within its obfuscated code.

Steve is in a Coma - A few parts of Minecraft could point to Steve actually being in a coma over the course of the game, and having to face his past. Most of the undead mobs in the game share Steve's face, for instance. He also doesn’t dream when he goes to sleep, probably because he’s already in one himself. The strongest piece of evidence, however, is the End Poem; besides comparing life as a long dream vs the short dream of the game (See: End Credits Poem), the last line of the End Credits instructs the player to “Wake Up”.
The dimensions in Minecraft could also represent different stages of subconsciousness. The overworld is surface-level subconsciousness, where imagination thrives and memories are kept in order. It represents the present. The nether, on the other hand, represents the traumas and regrets of our past. It symbolizes the chaotic part of our subconscious, housing our fears, instincts, motives, and urges. The last dimension, The End, is the most naïve and unknowing part of our mind; it represents the future. Challenging and slaying the Ender Dragon, the final conflict, is what allows Steve to accept his past and move on. The dragon drops an egg, a symbol of creation and rebirth, of getting another chance at life.

Mob Spawner Lich Phylacteries - A theory that attempts to explain the origin of mob spawners. It claims that there used to be a race of creatures that were experts in magic. In their search for immortality, they bound their souls to machines locked away in dungeons, with the hopes that they would regenerate their bodies once they became old and frail. Of course, as they grew older, their souls decayed more, and their new bodies decayed to match. Unable to stop the machines, those that bound their souls became stuck in a perpetual and agonizing cycle of rot, leading to the zombies and skeletons we find in mob spawners today.

Mojang Made a Home for Herobrine - A theory that the unknown entity known as Herobrine has manifested in other forms for much longer than Minecraft's existence, and that the game itself is just a way to keep Herobrine confined to one place. In every major update, "Removed Herobrine" is written, to pretend as if the entire matter is just a tongue-in-cheek joke the developers have accepted. To keep the public calm. Every update satiates the beast, but one day, it'll hunger.
(Also See: Herobrine, Herobrine Shrine, Herobrine Is Notch’s Brother, SCP-4335)

Steve's Sentience - An odd (and somewhat disturbing) story posted to the Minecraft Forums by user Nate86711 on November 23rd, 2011. It lasted long enough for someone to take screenshots of it (which I've put up via an Imgur album, original source unknown), but was most likely taken down shortly afterwards due to its content.

Don’t Look at the Moon - It’s not exactly about not looking at the moon. There’s a rumor that there’s code in Minecraft that checks whether or not you’re looking at the moon, and experiments were made to test it out, some having disastrous effects (“Shadow Entities”, “Being Set On Fire”, “World Corruption”), showing signs of being an outlandish creepypasta. Still, I decided to test them out for myself.









































HONORABLE MENTIONS:

Temple of Notch - An incredibly popular early map, posted to PlanetMinecraft on September 6 2011 by disco_. The map involves placing an offering into the “Well of Destiny” in order for a giant rock formation resembling Notch’s head to either wink and give you riches, or cry and drop you to your death. disco_’s other maps, Zombie Siege and Sonic The Hedgehog, are featured in the Official Redstone Handbook.

Deadmau5 Ears - Around December 2010, Deadmau5 announced he was going to play Minecraft, and even created his own server (Mau5ville.com). On December 21, Notch created an exclusive skin for Deadmau5, with ears popping out of the head. This type of Minecraft skin can’t be created by any other player as a result of this.

Uncensored Library - A server project by Reporters Without Borders, first released on March 12th 2020, to preserve and bring light to censored articles by journalists around the world. The website writes that "where almost all media is blocked or controlled, the world’s most successful computer game is still accessible," hence why such texts have been ported over in this way.

Suicidal Pandas - Pandas have a tendency to roll off an edge, no matter how high it is. It’s incredibly easy (and often frustrating) for pandas to die in this spectacular way.

Steve in Smash - Steve is in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate what the heck

TF2 Notch Hat - The “Top Notch” hat was added to Team Fortress 2 as a tribute to Minecraft on November 23, 2011. Minecraft easter eggs have existed in several other games as well, such as the Notched Pickaxe in Skyrim, or an entire blocky mineshaft containing creepers in Borderlands 2.

Stanley Parable Minecraft Reference - One of the routes in meta-narrative game The Stanley Parable references Minecraft, which the Narrator of the game disapproves of due to his desire to have a linear path in a narrative (whereas Minecraft is open-world and doesn't have a real narrative in the first place). In the Ultra Deluxe version of the Stanley Parable, this reference is relegated to a simple photo in the "Memory Zone"; the reason it was made non-playable was likely due to licensing issues with Mojang, or generally a desire to include more modern games into the mix.

Blocks In The End Feel Pain - In Minecraft's "The End: Ten Things You Probably Didn't Know About Minecraft" video, it's revealed that all of the blocks in the end can feel pain when mined. 

Minecraft Theology - A let’s play series by Jeremy Smith on the ChurchMag youtube channel, where he simultaneously plays Minecraft and explains Christian ideology. His most popular video has roughly 600 views, though the series had an article written about it by USAToday in 2018.

Vatican Minecraft Server - At the start of December 2019, Robert Ballecer (AKA PadreSJ or the Digital Jesuit) launched a Minecraft server in the Vatican, aimed at creating a toxic-free community. Only a short time after going live, the server was hit with griefing, DDoS attacks, and more. PadreSJ revealed that this was simply a test world to see which IP addresses would be responsible for potential attacks. On December 4, 2019, the official Vatican Minecraft server launched.

PETA Minecraft Server - On November 15th, 2014, PETA launched its own Minecraft server with the main concept being that no animals are allowed to be harmed in the world. Places players could check out included vegetable and flower gardens, a recreation of PETA's HQ, an abandoned slaughterhouse, and an old circus.

Haunt Muskie - One of the songs made by C418 that plays while you’re in flight, either in creative mode or via an elytra. This song uses the cave02.ogg sound as backing. Also, the song name is an anagram of Hatsune Miku.

Unofficial 20w14✨ Update - A community-made April Fool's 2020 update by members of the Minecraft Commands Discord server. https://minecraft.plagiatus.net/article/minecraft-snapshot-20w14%e2%9c%a8/  

Israphel - The iconic villain from Yogscast Lewis and Simon’s Minecraft series trilogy: Minecraft, Survival Island, and Shadow of Israphel. The first series lasted from December 2 to December 29, 2010, while Survival Island lasted from January 2 to January 12, 2011. Shadow of Israphel started on January 27 2011 and ended abruptly at Part 42: The Oasis on July 27, 2012. The reason for the sudden cancellation was a result of none of the members of the Yogscast feeling like working on the series was worth it. Some time down the line, the world file for the series was corrupted, dropping any attempts that could have been made to return to it. During one of Hannah’s Christmas Day 2013 episodes, Lewis revealed that almost every Minecraft series they’ve done since SOI actually ties into the main storyline. Yoglabs, for instance, could be a prequel series, with the laboratory eventually becoming the buried lab we see in The Oasis.

The Aether - A Minecraft mod released on July 22nd, 2011 and made by Brandon Pearce, otherwise known as kingbdogz. The Aether centers around the dimension of the same name, which could be accessed by constructing a portal out of glowstone and "lighting" it with a water bucket. The mod is currently being maintained for 1.7.10 and up on Curseforge by Gilded Games, of which Brandon Pearce is a team lead. 
Due to the immense popularity and Youtube coverage it received, many fans were led to believe that the Aether was a real dimension in the main game, leading to recurring waves of disappointment as they realized creating the portal did nothing.
A sequel to the Aether was released in an alpha state on June 9th, 2013, and is currently still being developed by Gilded Games.
On January 2020, kingbdogz moved to Sweden to work at Mojang as a Gameplay Developer for Minecraft.

2b2t - Dubbed the oldest anarchy server in Minecraft, as well as one of the oldest still-running Minecraft servers (created in December 2010, whereas multiplayer was officially added to Minecraft on May 31st 2009). 2b2t is known for being a chaotic sandbox where exploits run rampant. One of the most well-known members on the server is Popbob, an infamous griefer who joined 2b2t via 4chan in early 2011, although she has largely been inactive since the Third Incursion event in May 2015.

MinecraftForFree.com - A website that once hosted the entire game of Minecraft for free from 2011 to 2012, hosted by a user named Dylan (who later went on to became a member of Team Avolition, an infamous griefing team). 
After a takedown notice via email by Notch in 2012, Dylan and Storm_Surge (another member of Team Avolition) decided to savor this moment as best they can and challenge Notch to a best of 3 game in Quake 3 Arena—a reference to when Notch challenged Bethesda in the exact same way during the Scrolls / Elder Scrolls lawsuit (Also See: Mars Effect). 
Team Avolition lost the match, and as part of their conditions they decided to make a dubstep song in honor of Notch (whereas they would have potentially received their own capes if they won), as well as taking down the MinecraftForFree website (although that was going to happen no matter what).

Infinite Fire Spread - Before Beta 1.6 Test Build 3 on May 25th, 2011, fire could spread to adjacent flammable blocks indefinitely. This led to an infinite fire spread, where entire forests could be burned down starting from a single fire source. While this was patched out, it made a short resurgence again in August of 2012, and again a bit over 5 years later in several snapshots of 1.13 from November 2017 to May 2018.
