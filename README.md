# The Minecraft Iceberg V3, Finally - 314+ Entries! (EXPLANATION DOC LINKED)

Here's an easily clickable link to the explanation doc! 314 entries, plus 18 more in Honorable Mentions. 48 pages, 22.8k words in all. Yeesh.

Haha! The first Minecraft Iceberg of 2022 is MINE! I've been busting my ass off for several hours straight a day ever since Christmas to get this out in time, hope y'all enjoy!

The doc is 99% complete where it stands, but I still have quite a bit to go. Namely, I need more sources, more connections to other entries, actual color-coded entries, and I also have to fill in like 1 or 2 missing entries. Trust me, I'll get to these eventually! I just need to rest right now.

Huge shout out to Mayor_N, Brandominos, Cinder, and Pepe El Mago for their really high quality videos on past icebergs of mine.

Another round of shout outs to Infinity Charly, HarleyTBS, NeoRafake, Zet22, ACIDRAMA, Krzair, Burrlo, skits king, Riplo, CurtbroG, kloudo, Mickael Candys, MANOS 57, Ruben Gaming, and the_xdude for making videos as well! I really appreciate the work that goes into all of them. Go give all of these channels some love!

Lastly, big thanks to u/guavamolepeepee, u/Firedude_, u/tetrapyronia, u/maybenotacarbutadoor, u/extome9001, u/Luke_96_, u/Foreign_Ad1494, u/Kellen1013, u/Goldpan2, u/mynameisjonas26, u/decitronal, u/Ziemniakus, u/SempIsFinewElP, u/TheMCNerd2014, u/illuminatisheep, u/ef_naf, u/jamescoolcrafter15, u/TheLogicalMine, and u/Personalized_Copy for help with collecting entries for the chart!

Thank you, so so much, for all the attention and support. It means a lot.
